# Elasticsearch

### (continued)

---


# Elasticsearch Review

* Used for: Searches, Logging, Analytics
  * full text search, online stores “suggested for you”, calculating geospatial data
* Stores data in JSON format
* Distributed - allows for lots of data, can search very fast
  * But write speed is slow compared to SQL
  * Data integrity is an issue
  * Do not use as a primary datastore

---

# Document Mapping

* Mapping is defining how the document and its fields/properties/props are stored and how it is indexed.   
	(You might think of this like a schema or migration for SQL.)
* Field datatypes include: text, keyword, date, boolean, ip, double.
  * object or nested which support nesting JSON
  * geo_point, geo_shape, completion (specialized types)
* Remember, you can index the same data multiple times. Maybe username is in a text field for full-text search but also in a keyword field for sorting/agg

---

# Mapping Explosions
<h3 style="text-align: center";>  * BOOM *</h3>

You can map data dynamically! Hey, we’ve been doing it!
* For dynamic fields, new field names will be auto added. If you don’t send ES data on the fields, it does this.
  * Some field types won’t be mapped correctly automatically (like geopoints).
* This is super powerful but can get out of hand, leading to a variety of errors referred to as mapping explosions.
* You can set limits to the number of fields, and how deep it can be nested to prevent errors (data loss).

---

# When Data Changes

* What if you need to add or change a field? re-indexing!
* `_reindex` doesn’t actually change data in place.
* It copies data over from an old index into a new one VERY FAST. You still have to set up the new one first.
* A good strategy is to timestamp the indices and keep an old one to fall back on in case of catastrophic failures
* `book_index` points to book_index_20180127193111111
* `book_index_201801251035111111` is still around just in case!

---

# Is there an easier way?

* Most production apps use a library. It’s faster to write and easier to avoid errors, with a little upfront learning cost.
* There are many language-specific official clients, with libraries built atop them:
  * Python - elasticsearch-py, requests, urllib
  * Ruby - elasticsearch-ruby, elasticsearch-rails, searchkick, chewy
  * … some others including .NET, JavaScript, PHP

---

# Elasticsearch in Java

* Spring Data Elasticsearch, Jest, Spring Data Jest, Java REST Client, Elastisch (Clojure)…
*  Internal Java API?
  * Since ES is written in Java, it is possible to use the internal Java API used by Elasticsearch itself instead of the REST API (higher maintenance cost could buy you faster implementation).

---

# Elasticsearch in the Browser: 

* We will be using Elasticsearch.js in jQuery:   
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/about.html
* Using ES in the browser is still experimental, but the learning overhead is low because syntax is very close to regular Elasticsearch.
* This should be a fast experience for the user because they won’t have to wait for round-trips to the server.

---

# Requests in the Browser

* We’re going to use JavaScript to have buttons submit searches on our data using Ajax.
* We will have to manage CORS in order to do this
  * CORS, what is it? Protect the user!
  * More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing

---

# More Practice!

* In the walkthrough, you will practice retrieving and creating document mappings.
* Then in the studio, you will set up Elasticsearch in your Airwaze project using Elasticsearch.js.
  * We’re going to write a query and handle it client-side using Ajax in jQuery.

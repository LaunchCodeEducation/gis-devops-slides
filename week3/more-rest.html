# More REST Topics

---

## Topics

We'll cover a few topics in this short lecture:

- Authentication / Authorization
- Application to mapping
- HATEOAS
- REST Maturity Model

---

## Securing an API

The REST API we have been working on is insecure:

--

- Anybody may access data via the API at any time

--

- When somebody accesses the API, we don't know who they are

---

## Authentication and Authorization

There are two related concepts that must be employed to properly secure an API: **authentication** and **authorization**

--

**Authentication** is the process by which the identity of a user/requester is determined. 

--

**Authorization** is the process by which it is determined what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

--

Remember that authentication is about _identity_, authorization is about _permissions_

---

## Basic Authentication

"Basic auth" can be enabled by the web server. 

![Basic Auth Flow](images/basic-auth.png)

---

## Basic Authentication

This forces clients to include an `Authorization` header with a proper username/password.

--

The header value has the form `Basic [Base64 encoding of username:password]`. If a request does not include proper credentials, a 401 status code is returned.

---

## The Problem With Basic Auth

Basic auth is a dumb/naive scheme. 

It is unable to distinguish between different users, and different types of requests. If a correct username/password pair is given, the request will _always_ be allowed.

--

Thus, there is no way to enable **authorization**. In other words, there is no way to allow different users to have different permissions.

---

## Key Authentication

A better solution is to enable **key authentication**. In this scheme, each API user must have key (a string of characters) that they submit in the request. 

--

- The key may be placed in the `Authorization` header, or in the URL as a query parameter (e.g. `http://api.mydomain.com/some_endpoint?api_key=abcd1234`)

--

- Permissions may be granted on an per-user basis

--

- A key is typically obtained by registering with the API provider using a traditional user account

---

## OAuth

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation. In short, this means it provides a mechanism for end-users of a service to grant an application access to their data.

--

Via the "OAuth flow", a key/token is issued dynamically by the API when a user grants the API client permission.

--

Examples of OAuth abound (cf. "Log in with Facebook" etc). We will learn about OAuth in detail toward the end of the class, but you should see the References section for this class for an intro article.

---

## REST APIs and Mapping

REST APIs can be used to serve geo data. We'll use these later in the course, but here are a couple of examples for now:

--

[Boundless GeoServer](https://boundlessgeo.com/geoserver/) makes geo data avilable via a REST API that is capable of serving GeoJson

--

[Bing Maps REST Service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701713.aspx) provides access to resources such as Locations, Elevations, Routes, Imagery, and more via a REST API

---

## Bing API Example

Let's look at examples in the documentation for [Locations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701710.aspx) resources

---

## HATEOAS

**HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)** is a constraint of the REST application architecture.

--

RESTful services implementing HATEOAS include **hypermedia links** to related resources in responses.

--

This has the effect of decoupling an application from an API, since the client may rely on the links returned to access additional resources, rather than hard-coding URLs to resources.

---

## HATEOAS Example

A request to `http://localhost:8080/api/customers` might return:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Alice",
        "links": [ {
            "rel": "self",
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/customer/1"
        },
        {
            "rel": "cart",
            "herf": "http://localhost:8080/api/carts/7"
        }]
    },
    ...
]
```

## The REST Maturity Model

_Developed by Leonard Richardson and [written about](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) by Martin Fowler_

The **REST Maturity Model** consists of 4 progressive levels that may be used to determine how "RESTful" an API is

--

[A good outline of the REST Maturity Model](http://restcookbook.com/Miscellaneous/richardsonmaturitymodel/)

---

## The REST Maturity Model

**Level 0**: Using HTTP as a communication format

--

**Level 1**: Serving resources. That is, endpoints are "nouns" that accept and provide resource-based data

--

**Level 2**: Using HTTP verbs to communicate actions to be taken on resources. At this level, a service is generally considered to be "RESTful"

--

**Level 3**: Implementing HATEOAS (ie. hypermedia controls) to make the API self-documenting, and decouple server and client

# Elasticsearch

## Mappings and Documents

---

# Elasticsearch Review

* Used for: Searches, Logging, Analytics
  * full text search, online stores "suggested for you", calculating geospatial data
* Stores data in JSON format
* Distributed - allows for lots of data, can search very fast
  * But write speed is slow compared to SQL
  * Data integrity is an issue
  * Do not use as a primary datastore
* ElasticSearch is a NoSQL datastore.

---

# NoSQL Data Stores

* NoSQL really means "Not SQL"
* There are no rows, just documents. (i.e. JSON)
* There are no tables, just indices of documents.
* There are no schemas, just whatever attributes are contained in the documents. (i.e. JSON)
* Each attribute has a type.

---

## Document Example

The following is a document.  All of the airport documents as a group are an index.

```
{
  "_index": "airwaze",
  "_type": "doc",
  "_id": "CvExRWEBwC2aoUMP7lNh",
  "_version": 1,
  "_source": {
    "name": "Port Moresby Jacksons International Airport",
    "airport_id": 5,
    "elevation_ft": 146,
    "location": {
      "type": "point",
      "coordinates": [
        147.22000122070312,
        -9.443380355834961
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


# Elasticsearch Index

* An index is a collection of similar data (books, people)
* Each piece of data is a document (like one record in SQL, a specific book)
* Each document is made up of fields, sometimes called properties
* Each field has a type, just like in SQL
* The types interact with searches. For instance, a geo distance query can only be run on a `geo_point` field

---

# Document Mapping

* A mapping defines how the document and its fields are stored and indexed

--

* You might think of this like a schema in SQL

--

* A field can be indexed multiple times in different ways. For example, a username might be treated as a text field for full-text search but also in a keyword field for sorting and aggregation.

---

# Field Types

* Field datatypes include:
  * `text`, `keyword`, `date`, `boolean`, `ip`, `double`
  * object or nested data, which support nesting JSON
  * specialized types like `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, `completion`

---

# _id

* Lucene/ES uses a foreign key `_id`, just like many other databases
* The contents will be a hash, not sequential numbers
  * This is to avoid collisions: two records accidentally being assigned the same `_id` because two nodes tried to write at the same time
  * Since data is potentially distributed to many servers, managing unique ids is complicated

---

# Default Mapping

TODO

---

# Mapping Explosions

You can map data dynamically! Hey, we’ve been doing it!

* For dynamic fields, new field names will be auto added. If you don’t send ES data on the fields, it does this.
  * Some field types won’t be mapped correctly automatically (like geopoints).
* This is very powerful but can get out of hand, leading to resource issues, referred to as **mapping explosions**
* You can set limits to the number of fields, and how deep it can be nested to prevent such issues

---

## Queries: Simple Matching

Find anything close.

```
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "TEXT"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Queries: Filter

Find only fields matching the criteria.

```nohighlight
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": { 
      "filter": [  # only include if passes criteria 
        {
				  "range" : {
            "elevation_ft" : {
              "gte" : 1100
            }
          }
  			}
			]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Queries: Aggregations: 

Perform calculations on groups of documents.

```nohighlight
GET _search
{
  "aggs": {
    "avg_elevation": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "elevation_ft"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Queries: Pagination

`size` limits results returned
`from` allows easy pagination

```nohighlight
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": { 
      "should": [ 
        {
          "match": {
            "name": "Airport"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "from": 0,
  "size": 50
}
```

---

# When Data Changes

* What if you need to add or change a field? re-indexing!
* `_reindex` doesn’t actually change data in place
* It copies data over from an old index into a new one quickly. You still have to set up the new one first.
* A good strategy is to timestamp the indices and keep an old one to fall back on in case of catastrophic failures
* `book_index` points to book_index_20180127193111111
* `book_index_201801251035111111` is still around just in case!

---

# What about Joins?

* ElasticSearch is composed of only documents, no tables.
* Joining with other documents is technically possible, but not recommended.
* Let's look at an example.

---

# Parent Child Relationships

* Documents that are related should be stored in a parent child relationship.
* There will be one document, that has nested JSON inside of it.

For Example:

* For each airport, there are many routes..
* Instead of two tables, each airport will contain the JSON for all routes. 

---

# Parent Child Example


```
{
  "_source": {
    "name": "Port Moresby Jacksons International Airport",
    "airport_id": 5,
    "elevation_ft": 146,
    "routes": [
				{
					"src": "STL",
					"dst": "LAX",
					"airline": "NZ"
				}
      ]
    ]
  }
}

```

# Kibana

***#DevTools for ElasticSearch***

Kibana sits on top of your ElasticSearch

Kibana provides:
* Fast, convenient way to access the data in your cluster.
* DevTools to run queries (no more cURL).
* Visualizations so that you can analyze your data.

>>> Walkthrough

---

# Elasticsearch.js

* We will be using [Elasticsearch.js in jQuery](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/about.html) 
* Allow you to execute ElasticSearch queries directly from the browser.

---

# Elasticsearch.js

<div class = "left-column" >

  <ul>
    <li>Queries in this library are virtually the same syntax as regular Elasticsearch.</li>
    <li>We’ll cover this in more depth in the walkthrough.</li>
  </ul>
</div>  

<div class = "right-column" >
  <img   src = "clientsearch.png">
</div>  
---

# Requests in the Browser

* We’re going to use JavaScript to have buttons submit searches on our data using Ajax.
* We will have to manage CORS in order to do this
  * In the walkthrough we will show you how to tell your Elasticsearch cluster that your application is allowed to access the data, called “whitelisting.”
  * By default, web browsers are not allowed to make requests to other servers. This is to prevent data from being pushed and pulled from unauthorized web sites.

---

# CORS, What Is It?

* CORS stands for "cross origin resource sharing."
* This is a W3 spec meant to prevent malicious behavior on websites.
* CORS allows servers to specify not just who can access its assets, but also how the assets can be accessed.
* Further reading: https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-cors  

---

# More Practice!

* In the walkthrough, you will practice retrieving and creating document mappings.
* Then in the studio, you will set up Elasticsearch in your Airwaze project using Elasticsearch.js.
  * We’re going to write a query and handle it client-side using Ajax in jQuery.

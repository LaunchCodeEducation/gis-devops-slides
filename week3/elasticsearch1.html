# Elasticsearch

## Introduction

---

## Today

* Intro to Elasticsearch

--

* CRUD operations with ES

--

## Tomorrow

--

* Advanced ES features

--

* Integrating ES into a Spring application

---

## Use cases

* Advanced search
  * Full-text search
  * Online stores (e.g. "suggested for you" features)
  * Indexing very large data sets

--

* Analytics - for very large datasets

--

* **Not** for primary datastore (data loss/corruption)

---

## Relational Databases

* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite

--

* Defined schema w/ several tables per database or schema

--

* Allows you to set restrictions, run `JOIN` queries, avoid consistency issues

--

* Data is "normalized" to reduce redundancy and update issues
![table1](images/table1.png)

---

## Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases

* Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, Apache Cassandra

--

* Flexible, dynamic table design

--

* Fast, can be distributed  

--

* No defined schema 

---

## NoSQL Document

Data is stored as documents, rather than rows in tables

![snippet](images/snippet.png)

---

## JSON

<div class = "left-column" >

<ul>
	<li>JavaScript Object Notation
	<li>Data is text
	<li>Converts to a JS object simply, quickly, no parsing
	<li>Key:Value pairs make it easy to understand

</div>

<div class = "right-column">

</div>

---

## Lucene

Elasticsearch is built on Lucene, a search library written in Java.

--

* Stores data in an **index** of documents
  * Each **document** has **fields**
  * For now, think of an index as the analog of a database in a relational database 

--

* Inverted indexes - like in back of textbook (faster to search, slower to write)

--

* Allows fields to be weighted using the `boost` parameter

--

* Lucene Query Syntax

---

## Talking To Elasticsearch

With Java, we can talk to Elasticsearch via: 

--

* **Node client** - The node client joins a local cluster as a non-data node. In other words, it doesn’t hold any data itself.

--

* **Transport client** - Can be used to send requests to a remote cluster. It doesn’t join the cluster itself, but simply forwards requests to a node in the cluster.

--

> Both of these clients communicate on port 9300

---

## REST API

For other scenarios, Elasticsearch provides a REST API that communicates using JSON over HTTP.

We will predominantly use this API to talk to ES. 

--

- Available on port 9200

--

- We'll use the `curl` command to access the API via the command line

---

## curl Basics

The generic `curl` usages looks like: 

```nohighlight
$ curl -X<VERB> <OPTIONS> '<URL>' -d '<BODY>'
```

--
<br>

The components are: 

- `VERB` - the HTTP verb to use (`GET`, `POST`, etc); default is `GET`
- `OPTIONS` - `curl` options; the most common for us will be `-H 'Content-type: application/json'` (to set the `Content-type` HTTP header)
- `URL` - the endpoint to make the request to
- `BODY` - the request body (ommitted for `GET` requests); this can be split across lines


---

## Let's use Elasticsearch!

--

Install ES and it's partner, Kibana, via Homebrew:

--

```
$ brew install elasticsearch 
$ brew install kibana 
```

--

Start both of the apps as services:

``` 
$ brew services start elasticsearch 
$ brew services start kibana 
```

---

## Verify that it's running

```
$ curl localhost:9200
```

You should receive a response containing info about the ES instance.

```
{
  "name" : "nPGurEK",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch_chris",
  "cluster_uuid" : "08zrCrAiQwOEHAnByAIyLw",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.5.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    ... 
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

---

## The _cat API

The endpoint `/_cat` provides a list of metadata endpoints that we can access.

```
$ curl localhost:9200/_cat
=^.^=
/_cat/allocation
/_cat/shards
/_cat/shards/{index}
/_cat/master
/_cat/nodes
/_cat/tasks
/_cat/indices
/_cat/indices/{index}
[content ommitted]
```

---

## The _cat API

What does this return? 

```
$ curl localhost:9200/_cat/indices
```

---

## Indices

* An index is a collection of similar documents (books, people)

--

* Each piece of data is a document (like one record in SQL, e.g. a specific book)

--

* Each document is made up of fields, sometimes called properties

--

* Each field has a type, just like in SQL (integer, string, etc)

--

* The types interact with searches. For instance, a geo distance query can only be run on a `geo_point` field

---

## ES versus Relational Databases 

A rough parallel can be drawn:

Relational DB  ⇒ Databases ⇒ Tables ⇒ Rows      ⇒ Columns

Elasticsearch  ⇒ Indices   ⇒ Types  ⇒ Documents ⇒ Fields

---

## Creating Documents

To create a document, `POST` to a URL of the form `/<INDEX>/<TYPE>` with the document as the request body: 

--

```
$ curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/library/books' -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '
{
  "title": "Infinite Jest",
  "author": "David Foster Wallace"
}'
```

---

## The Response


```
{
  "_index": "library",
  "_type": "books",
  "_id": "h9FPyGcBWCX-HNnRrdF4",
  "_version": 1,
  "result": "created",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 0,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```

---

## A New Index

Again, try:

```
$ curl localhost:9200/_cat/indices
```

---

# Shorthand

Rather than writing out the full `curl` command, we'll often use: 

```json
POST /library/books?pretty
{
  "title": "Infinite Jest",
  "author": "David Foster Wallace"
}
```

when we mean: 

```
$ curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/library/books?pretty' -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '
{
  "title": "The Overstory",
  "author": "Richard Powers"
}'
```

---

# Other Index Endpoints 

With your knowledge of REST, see if you can figure out how to **retrieve** and **delete** a document.

**Tip**: Use the `?pretty` param to get nicely formatted output

--

```
GET /library/books/<ID>?pretty 
```

```
DELETE /library/books/<ID>?pretty 
```

---

# Basic Searching

Conduct a search via the `_search` endpoint for the index: 

```
GET /library/_search?q=title:overstory
```

**Note**: The `pretty` parameter doesn't play nicely with this endpoint. 

---

# Search Results

```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 5,
    "successful" : 5,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      [results ommitted]
    ]
  }
}
```

---

# Search Results

The response tells us:
* `hits` - search results info
* `hits.hits` - actual array of search results

Note that only 10 results are returned by default. We can customize the result set using the `from` and `size` parameters.

---

## Better Search

Before we explore some better search methods, let's start using Kibana to query Elasticsearch.

--

In your browser, go to [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

One you are there, select the **Dev Tools** view from the left-hand menu

---

## Better Search

We can use the body of a `GET` request to submit more sophisticated search criteria.

For example:

```
GET /library/_search
{
  "query": { 
    "match_all": {} 
  }
}
```

---

## Full-Text Queries

**Full text queries** are used to run searches on text fields like: email body, description of item

### Examples

`match`, `multi_match`, `match_phrase`

--

They apply analyzers. (What's an analyzer?!)

---

## What's an Analyzer?

An analyzer:

* Break text content down into word stems (known as tokens or terms)
* Those tokens are added to the inverted index
* Words like "the" and "and" are skipped

--

* Can be customized for each text field in a mapping

--

* ES includes an English default analyzer

---

## Searching By Field

```
GET /library/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "overstory"
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Aggregations

* Aggregations allow you to group and provide statistics about your data

--

* ES can return hits and aggregated results in _one_ response

--

* Hits and aggregations are listed separately in the response

---

## Aggregations

With results: 

```
GET /library/_search
{ 
  "aggs": { 
    "group_by_author": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "author.keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Aggregations

Without results: 

```
GET /library/_search
{ 
  "size": 0, 
  "aggs": { 
    "group_by_author": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "author.keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

--

This is similar in SQL: `SELECT author, COUNT(\*) FROM library GROUP BY author ORDER BY COUNT(\*) DESC`

---

## Aggregations

* An aggregation is like a function that builds a result set over a group of documents

* You can get numeric aggregations like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, `range` that are relatively easy to get out of SQL but are tough in a distributed environment

---

## Nodes, Clusters & Shards, Oh My!


* A **cluster** is a group of 1+ servers, who index/search together. 

-- 

* A **node** is a single server, participating in the ES cluster. 

--

* A **shard** is a bucket of data within a node. This allows one index to be split among multiple nodes in one cluster. A node has one or more shards. 

--

* ES will manage finding data in the various shards via a **master node** when there are 2+ nodes in your cluster.
	
---

## Clusters

<img src="images/clusterdiagram.png" style="height:500px !important;" />

---

## Fault Tolerance

* "health" and failure tolerance

--

* Replicas distributed on different nodes in case of failures

--

* Master node figures out which node has your data

--

* Scale out — searches can be executed on replicas in parallel

---

## How Healty Is Our Cluster?

```
GET localhost:9200/_cat/health?v
```
--


**Green** - everything is good (cluster is fully functional)

**Yellow** - all data is available but some replicas are not yet allocated (cluster is fully functional, but more vulnerable to data loss/corruption)

**Red** - some data is not available for whatever reason (cluster is partially functional)

---

# Let Someone Else Manage It

Elasticsearch clusters are often set up on services such as:

* AWS Hosted ES Service
* Heroku's Bonsai service
* Searchly (IBM)

---

# ES Alternatives

* **Stretch PostgreSQL or PostGIS before you reach for ES**
* Apache Solr (also built on Lucene)
* Sphinx
* RavenDB (MS)

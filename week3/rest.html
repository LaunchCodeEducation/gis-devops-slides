# Week 3 - Day 1
# RESTful Web Services

---

## Resources

A **resource** is an entity on the Internet that has an identity and can be retrieved (i.e. has an address).

We will typically think of a resource as a piece of "business data".

--

## Examples

- Mike's user account on launchcode.org
- The weather report for Monday, January 29 2018 for St. Louis, MO from wunderground.com
- The map of the Fountain Park neighborhood of St. Louis

---

## Resources Formats

The _format_ of a resource is an independent concept from the resource itself. Resources may be represented in different formats.

--

### Format Examples

- HTML
- JSON
- XML

---

## URI / URL

We identify resources using **uniform resource identifier** (URI), which is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a resource.

--

A **uniform resource locator** (URL), also known as a "web address", is a type of URI.

--

**Note**: URIs and URLs are _not_ the same, but we'll only use URLs in this course.

---

## URL Examples

- `http://launchcode.org`
- `https://twitter.com/launchcode/status/956273687170289666`
- `ftp://myfileserver.com/info.pdf`
- `mailto:chris@launchcode.org`

---

## URL Anatomy

```nohighlight
scheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]
```
<br />
<br />
--

For us, the scheme will almost always be `http` or `https`, and the most important/common portions are: scheme/protocol, host, port, path, query.

---

## REST

**Representational State Transfer** (REST) is a set of constraints, or standards, for web services that allow systems to access and manipulate web resources.

REST was defined by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000.

--

A "RESTful" web service:
- Is stateless
--

- Is idempotent
--

- Uses HTTP/S to facilitate client/server communication
--

- Uses URLs to identify resources
--

- Uses HTTP/S methods to communicate actions to be taken on a resource

---

## RESTful URLs

In REST, the URL identifies a resource. In practice, this means that the _path_ portion of the URL determines the resource in question at a given service.

--

- `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/show/956273687170289666` - the status (aka tweet) with ID 956273687170289666

--

- `http://launchcode.org/api/users/7` - the user with ID 7

-- 

- `http://launchcode.org/api/users` - all users

Note the distinction between _individual_ resources and _collections_ of resources in the last two examples. An individual resource will typically have an identifier (numeric or otherwise), while a collection 

---

## HTTP

Recall that HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is the mechanism by which most web communications occur. It is based on a request/response exchange between a client and server that uses a standard format.

---

## HTTP Request Format

---

## HTTP Response Format

---

## HTTP Methods

In REST, HTTP methods function as the **verbs** for a given request. Whereas a URL identifies a resource (the **noun** of a request), the HTTP method used determines what should be done with that resource.

--

- `POST` - create a new resource
- `PUT` - replace the resource
- `GET` - retrieve the resource (read only)
- `DELETE` - remove the resource

---

## HTTP Status Codes

In the response, HTTP status codes communicate the result of the action taken.

--

- 1xx - General information 
- 2xx - Success
- 3xx - Redirect
- 4xx - Client side error
- 5xx - Server side error

--

Most REST requests will have a response code of 200 (everything went as expected) or 201 (a new resource was created).

---

## Resource Format

As we saw before, the **format** of a resource can vary (e.g. HTML, JSON, XML, etc). A resource in a given format is a **representation** of that resource.

--

The `Content-Type` header is used to communicate the format of the resource transfered in the HTTP request body. Common values are `application/json` and `application/xml`.

--

The `Accept` header is used to determine which format the server should return to the client. It can take on the same values as `Content-Type`, commonly know as **media types**.

--

The server is responsible for correctly handling and formatting the given resource based on the values of `Accept` and `Content-Type`.

---

## Idempotence

The concept of **idempotence** means that carrying out the same request twice has the same result as carrying it out once. 

In other words, if we ask a server to create a new resource via a `POST` request, and we repeat the request twice, a new resource is not created twice. 

---

## Statelessness

REST services are **stateless**. This means that the server does not remember the requesting client from one request to another, and neither history nor context is preserved from one request to another.

--

REST requests must be authenticated each and every time (more on this tomorrow).

--

For a web application, state may exist in the form of cookies, sessions, or JavaScript. State _does not_ exist in the context of REST communications though.

---

## Nested Resources

As with model objects, resources can be "owned" by other resources. When this happens, the owned resource lives "below" the owning resource in the identifying URL.

--

### Examples

- `/companies/1234`
- `/companies/1234/departments`
- `/companies/1234/departments/7/`
- `/companies/1234/departments/7/employees`

---

## Query Parameters as Filters

In REST URLs, query paramters are used to filter collections.

--

### Examples

- `/companies?state=MO` - companies based in MO
- `/companies/1234/employees?gender=F` - all female employees at the company with ID 1234

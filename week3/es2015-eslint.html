# Day 5
### ES2015, ESLint, Webpack

---

## JavaScript

* Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich for Netscape
--

* Later became an independent specification (ECMA Script) that others could implement it
--

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript (Click to see the versions)
--

* ES2015 (the 6th version of ECMAScript) was a major change and is used by new projects at the NGA

---


## Where Does JavaScript Run (execute) ?
--

* Server via Node.js
  * Language features are defined by what is installed on the server
--

* Browser
  * Language features allowed depends on the browser
--

* How can we check what is supported in each browser?  
  * [https://caniuse.com/#search=es6](https://caniuse.com/#search=es6)

---
## How to Use ES2015 even if your target environment does not?
* You can use a tool called a **transpiler**
--

* A transpilier will convert your ES2015 code into a version of JavaScript that will run on your target env
--

* Babel is the transpiler used at the NGA
--

* Babel is incorpated into the js build tool to produce environment friendly js while allowing the developers use new language features
  * How do you feel about that?

---
## Linting
--

* “Linting” does not mean to put lint into your code
--

* It means to a analyze code by checking if it complies with a set of coding rules/standards
--

* The name refers to removing lint. We want to remove bugs and bad styles from our code.
--

  * The first *linter* was using in 1978 for the c language
  * More history here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)
--

* There are numerous *linters*, multiples for each language
  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis](List of code analyzers by language)


---
## Linting Rules

* There are many rules and code styles decisions to be considered when writing JavaScript
--

* How does the team stay consistent and produce similar, industry standards compliant code?
--

* First you pick a set of rules your code should follow.
--

* Then make sure all code that is committed passes the rule set

---
## Enforce the Rules

* Use tools like ESLint to analyze our files
--

* Use rule sets like the Airbnb ESLint rules (used at the NGA)
--

* Don't let the code build or be merged until all code passes

---
##ES2015

* Sometimes linters can be used to ensure new language featurs are being used
--

* Like the new JavaScript features in ES2015
--

* We are now going to take a look at some of those features...

---
## ES2015 - let
```javascript
{
  var name = 'Percy';
}
console.log(name);
```
```javascript
{
  let name = 'Percy';
}
console.log(name);
```

---
## ES2015 - const
```javascript
var user = { name: 'percy', id: 1};
user = 'percy';
console.log(user.name);  //Throws runtime error!
```
```javascript
const user = { name: 'percy', id: 1};
//user = 'percy'; THIS NO LONGER COMPILES
console.log(user.name);
```

---
## ES2015 - Template Strings
```javascript
  const name = "Percy's";
  const sentence = name + " lucky number is " + Math.random() + "\n" + "wow i'm on a new line!";
  console.log(sentence);
```
```javascript
  const name = "Percy's";
  const sentence = `${name} lucky number is ${Math.random()}
  wow i'm on a new line!`;  //can contain new lines
  console.log(sentence);
```

---
## Fat Arrow Functions =>
```javascript
const add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
console.log(add(1,2));
```
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
console.log(add(1,2));
```
```javascript
const add = (a,b) =>  a + b;
console.log(add(1,2));
```

---
## Fat Arrow Functions => pt 2
```javascript
const isEven = function(x) {
  return x % 2 == 0;
};
console.log(isEven(2));
```
```javascript
const isEven = (x) => {
  return x % 2 == 0;
};
console.log(isEven(2));
```
```javascript
const isEven = x => x % 2 == 0;
console.log(isEven(2));
```

---
## Fat Arrow Functions => pt 3
```javascript
const getRandom = function() {
  return Math.random() * 100 1;
};
console.log(getRandom());
```
```javascript
const getRandom = () =>  Math.random() * 100;
console.log(getRandom());
```

---
## Default Parameter Values
```javascript
const getRandom = (multiplier = 100) =>  Math.random() * multiplier;
console.log(getRandom(10));
console.log(getRandom(7));
console.log(getRandom());
```
---
## Compare ES2015 to Old 
* [Try out ES2015 with Babel](http://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&browsers=&build=&builtIns=false&code_lz=NoRgNATGDMC6B0BbAhgBwBQDsAEBeAfNjgNTYgCUA3EA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=true&fileSize=false&lineWrap=false&presets=es2015%2Clatest&prettier=false&targets=&version=6.26.0&envVersion=)

---
## Leaving a Few Things Out
* Not covering these other features of ES2015
  * Classes
  * Promises
  * Spread Operators
  * Destructring
* I don’t want your heads to explode… yet

---
##Webpack

* Build tool for JavaScript projects
--

* Basically like Gradle, but for JavaScript
--

* Turns numerous (html, .js, .css files) into a few build artifacts
--

* Like springBoot, Webpack has a handy development web server that you can use locally
--

* More details and a cool diagram here https://webpack.js.org/

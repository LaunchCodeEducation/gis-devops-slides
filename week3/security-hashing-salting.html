# SECURITY FOCUS
## Sensitive Data Exposure

---

## Sensitive Data Exposure
--

- Number 3 on OWASP top 10 for 2017
- [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)

---
## Encryption vs Hashing
--

- Encryption 
  - Is a two way algorithm, uses keys to encrypt and decrypt data
  - Used for sensitive data that needs to be securely stored and also **readable**
--

- Hashing
  - Is a one way algorithm, that turns data into an alternative version in order to hide the true value
  - Used for data(passwords) that will NOT be read in it's original form, but will be stored in your system

---

## Classify the Data
--

- What data is sensitive? 
- What defines sensitive in your organization?
--

- What needs to be kept long term?
--

- Don’t store more than you need!
  - Use the data and get rid of it
  - It **can't** be hacked if it’s not stored
---

## Be Strong
--

- If you have sensitive data, take the time to secure it **properly**
--

- Act as if your data will be breached
  - Prepare to make it hard for your data to be used
--

- Do your research
  - Use *strong*, *adaptable* **hashing** algorithms
  - Follow guidelines from security groups like OWASP
  - Use proper key management for **encrypting**
---

## Limit Access to the Data
--

- Limit access to servers to the absolute minimum
--

- Don't give everyone on the internet a chance to hack your servers
--

- Keep data servers inside a VPN or VPC
--

- Lock down the ports
--

- Don't give every db user access to all tables

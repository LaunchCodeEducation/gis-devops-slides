# Intro to OAuth2

---

## Authentication and Authorization

There are two related concepts that must be employed to properly secure an API: **authentication** and **authorization**

--

**Authentication** is the process by which the identity of a user/requester is determined. 

--

**Authorization** is the process by which it is determined what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

--

Remember that authentication is about _identity_, authorization is about _permissions_

---

## Review of Key Authentication

In this scheme, each API user must have key (a string of characters) that they submit in the request. 

--

- The key may be placed in the `Authorization` header, or in the URL as a query parameter (e.g. `http://api.mydomain.com/some_endpoint?api_key=abcd1234`)

--

- Permissions may be granted on an per-user basis

--

- A key is typically obtained by registering with the API provider using a traditional user account

---

## Problems With Key Auth

- API users have to obtain a key directly from the API provider, usually through a web portal

--

- There's no mechanism for expiring and renewing keys

--

- While key's can provide per-user access to data, it's not reasonable for an API client to obtain keys to access individual user data (e.g. a key to access your Facebook account)

---

## OAuth2 to the Rescue

- Provides authentication for users using an external site w/o giving a third party your password

--

- Allows for access to user data at a third party

--

- Can be read/write, read-only, or provide more complex access schemes (access by data type or function)

--

- Prevents devs from having to use multiple proprietary authentication and authorization protocols when building their apps

---

## Tokens Good, Passwords Bad

OAuth2 controls access to services by issueing **tokens** which are similar to keys but carry additional power

--

We _could_ just give an application our account credetials, so it could, say log into Facebook for us. This wouldn't be a good idea though.

- Why not use passwords?
    - Trust: what if the app stores your password or shares with another party?
    - Using passwords is easier to exploit via phishing
    - Can't restrict access to data when not using passwords
    - Access turned off when passwords are changed
    - A user can't easily revoke access

---

## OAuth Roles

- **Resource server**: Hosts user-owned resources that are protected by OAuth. This is typically an API provider that holds and protects data.

--

- **Resource owner**: The user of an application, the resource owner has the ability to grant access to their own data hosted on the resource server.

--

- **Client**: An application making API requests to perform actions on protected resources on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.

--

- **Authorization server**: Gets consent from the resource owner and issues access tokens to clients for accessing protected resources. Can be the same as the resource server.

--

- **User Agent**: How the user accesses the client

---

---

## Using OAuth as a Client

Using OAuth as a client requires **application registration** with the OAuth provider.

--

The provider gives you a **client ID** and a **client secret** that are required for interating with the provider.

--

**Keep the client ID secret! Duh!**

---

## Client profiles

There are a few types of OAuth clients:

- Server-side app
- Client-side app
- Native app (desktop or mobile)
- service-to-service app

---

## Confidential vs. Public Clients

We can subdivide these into **confidential** and **public**

--

- Confidential: Server-side web apps. These can keep tokens secret from resource owner

--

- Public: Client-side web apps, mobile apps. These can't reliably keep tokens secret

--

**Dumb question**: Why would you want to keep the token secret from the user?

---


## Access token (or "Bearer Token")

- Sent by the client to the resource server to access protected resources
- May be valid for a short period (implementation specific)
- Can be verified by the authorization server or the resource server

---

## Refresh token

- Valid for a longer period
- Used to request a new access or identity token when the current one
expires
- The process is transparent for the resource owner
- When a refresh token expires, the client must re-authenticate
- Usually involves a database lookup, so authorization can be revoked


---

## Grant Types

There are 4 types of **grant types** used for issueing tokesn to differnt types of clients

--
- Auth Code (Server-side Web Apps)

--

- Password (Native Mobile Apps)

--

- Implicit (Client-side Web Apps)

--

- Client Credentials (Service-to-service Apps)

---

## Auth Code Flow

Perhaps the most widely used and discussed flow. Also sometimes called the "OAuth Dance"

--

- Default and most secure flow: no access token on the browser, no user/
password sent to client

--

- The client must securely be able to hold the client ID, client secret and tokens

--

- Called 3 legged OAuth because the identity of the three main actors is
checked (authorization server, resource owner, client)

---

## Auth Code Flow

---

## Password Flow

Sometime called “native mobile app” or “resource owner password” flow
- For cases when the resource owner trusts giving the password to the client (e.g. same company)
- Usually the resource owner only trusts the Authorization Server login component
- The client uses the username and password when requesting tokens, but does not store them
after that
– Only the access and refresh tokens should be stored by the client
- Uses credentials as authorization- no authorization endpoint is used
- Example: PCF CLI

---

## Password Flow

---

## Single-page JS App Flow (Implicit Grant Type)

- For cases where the client can’t securely hold the refresh token and ClientSecret (e.g.
JavaScript in the browser)
    - No refresh tokens or ClientSecrets are used
    - Access tokens are issued directly from the authorization endpoint- no authorization code is
    used
    - Only the ClientID and `redirect_uri` are sent when requesting tokens
    - The `redirect_uri` sent must match the `redirect_uri` sent when originally registering the client
- Simple but less secure- only one call to the authorization endpoint is necessary

---

## Implicit Flow

![Implicit Flow](images/implicit-flow.png)

---

## Service-to-Service App Flow (Client Credentials Grant Type)

- Also known as 2-legged OAuth
- For cases where the client is also the resource owner, or there is no resource owner
    -  User credentials not necessary- client credentials are used for the authorization grant
- Client must register with the OAuth server, and receives a ClientID and a ClientSecret
- Client then sends the ClientID and ClientSecret to the token endpoint
- Client must securely keep the ClientID, ClientSecret, access token and refresh token
- No authorization endpoint or `redirect_uri` is used

---

## Client Credentials Flow

---

## OAuth1 vs. OAuth2

OAuth2 supersedes the OAuth1 spec, and attempts to solve some issues with it

- OAuth2 provides for non-client/server flows

--

- OAuth2 removes the more difficult cryptographic signature portion of the spec (though some OAuth2 services support or require it)

--

- OAuth2 uses bearer tokens in place of signing

---

## Request Signing Vs. Bearer Tokens

If not signing requests, remain secure by: 

--

- Using HTTPS

--

- Verifying that the cert hostname matches the URL being accessed

--

- Veryfying each cert in the chain up to a trusted cert

--

- Make sure the cert bundle on the server is secure

---

## How Tokens Are Sent

- Auth header

--

- Query param

--

- Request body

**Note:** Prefer auth header b/c: headers are rarely cached or logged and it's universally supported according to oauth spec

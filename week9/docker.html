# Intro to Docker


### Incredibly Fast, Lightweight, version-controlled 

###**Linux Containers** 

---

## Docker

* Docker was founded an Open Source project in 2013 as a way to provide extremely light weight **Linux containers**.

--

* In 2015, Docker formed the Open Container Initiative as a means to provide open source governance to the spread of **Linux containers**.

--

* Docker (and Linux container technologies) are seeing widespread adoption across the inudstry and are used heavily in **Cloud Native** applications. 

---

## Linux **Containers**

### What are they?

--
"A LinuxÂ® container is a set of processes that are isolated from the rest of the system, running from a distinct image that provides all files necessary to support the processes."

--

* Essentially, a Linux container is a standalone Linux machine that is running on top of an existing Linux OS.

---

## Linux **Containers**

### An Example

You have a CentOS EC2 Instance runnning on AWS with Docker installed.

--

This allows you to spin up a PostGIS container.

--

* The PostGIS container has its own image.
--

* The PostGIS container has its own processes.
--

* The PostGIS container exposes port 5432.
---

## Linux **Containers**

### Example Continued

You would also have the ability to spin up other images:
--

* An Elasticsearch image you could talk to on port 9300.
--

* An GeoServer image you could talk to on port 8080.
--

* A Node image for a microserver on port 8001.
--

---

## Why **Linux Containers** and Docker?

--

### **Linux Containers** are everything we ever wanted VMs to be and more...

--

* Incredibly fast spin up time.  Docker prebakes images.
--

* Version Control.  Docker allows images to be scripted.  
--

* Replicable Environments.  Docker images spin up the same everytime.
--

* Immutability.  Create once, then throw away.

---

## Docker - How it works...

--

###**First:** Dockerfile 

* A script that specifies the base image (Linux flavor) and what should be installed. 

--

###**Second:** Image 

* `docker build` "prebakes" your Dockerfile as an image so that it can be spun up quickly. 

--

###**Third:** Container

* `docker run` creates a Linux **container** based on your image.

---

## **First:** Dockerfile

`Dockerfile` is the blue print for the Image that is used to create a container.

```
# the base image
FROM centos:7

# install commands
RUN yum -y update
RUN rpm -ivh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

# specify the port to be exposed
EXPOSE 8080


# run the application
CMD["python", "-m SimpleHTTPServer"]
```

---

## **Second:** Image

`docker build` runs the Dockerfile and "prebakes" an image.

```
$ docker build --tag example .

Sending build context to Docker daemon  68.61kB

 Step 2/4 : RUN yum -y update

```

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY  TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
example     latest              6bb88ddf2b57        4 minutes ago       374MB
```

---

## **Third:** Container

`docker run` starts up a container of the specified image

```
$ docker run -i -t example
[root@f91976ba8452 /]# 
[root@f91976ba8452 /]# ls
anaconda-post.log  bin  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

```
$ docker ps 
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE     COMMAND     CREATED              STATUS    PORTS             NAMES
f91976ba8452  example   "/bin/bash" About a minute ago   Exited (0)   8 seconds ago   amazing_brown
```

## Docker **Best Practices**

### Docker containers are designed to run one process.

--

* The CMD line in your Dockerfile indicates the one process that should be running.

--

* The container should only have one responsibility, on main job.

--

* Using **Docker Compose** multiple Docker containers can be linked together (i.e. web app container and a database container).: 

---

## Docker **Best Practices**

### Docker containers are designed to be immutable.

--

* All of the container setup is scripted in the Dockerfile.

--

* Immutability means a consistently known state.  Update the Dockerfile, throw away all of your containers and spin up new ones. 


---

## Docker **Best Practices**

### Avoid storing application data on the Docker container.  

--

* Remember Docker is essentially version controlling the file system.  It increases the size of your container.

--
* In development, use the `mount` flag to write or reference directly to the host machine. 

--
* In production, logs should stream to a log aggregation service.

### Common Docker Commands

There are several commands you need to know:

* **`docker build`**  - creates an image based on a Dockerfile
* **`docker run`**    - creates a container based on an image
* **`docker ps`**     - lists all available images
* **`docker stop`**   - turns off a container
* **`docker rm`**     - deletes an image
* **`docker --help`** - look up all of the commands you don't know

---

## Docker Commands 

###`docker build` 

Options

* `docker build --tag someName`  - specifies "someName" as the name of your image.

--

Other useful commands:
* `docker images` - lists all images currently on your machine.
* `docker rmi someName` - deletes the image named "someName"

---

## Docker Commands 
### `docker run`

Options

`docker run someName`   - Create a container from the someName image.

--

`docker run -i -t someName`   - Start a container with the terminal as the main process

--

`docker run -p 80:8080 someName`   - Publish port 8080 of the container on port 80 of 127.0.0.1 (the machine running Docker) 

--

`docker run --name myContainer someName` - Create a container named "myContainer"

---

## Docker Commands

### Other helpful commands

-- 

`docker ps` - list all running containers

--

`docker ps -a` - list all containers

--

`docker stop someName` - stop the container named "someName"

--

`docker rm someName` - delete the container named "someName"

--

`docker logs someName` - view all of the written to STDOUT for "someName"

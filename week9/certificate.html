# Certificate Authentication


### Highly **Secure** Access to Websites, Servers, and Services 

---

## Certificates mean **Trust**

* Certificates are based on public private key encryption another party to verify your identity.

--

* Every secure transaction online involves a certificate to verify that you are actually talking to the website (Amazon, Google, LaunchCode) that you think you are talking to.

--

* Certificates can also be used to verify the identity of users.  Highly secure because certificates are cryptographically sound (where as a username password combination can be guessed or cracked). 

---

## Certifcates: How exactly do they work?

### *Trust has to start somewhere*

--

There are two typical scenarios where certificates are used:  

--

1) An organization wants to verify it's online presence.  

--

2) An organization wants to verify the identity of its user.

---

## Certificates for Identity

For website certificates, well know Certificate Authorities (CAs) will vouch for an organization's identity.

--

For Example:

--

* Your buy a certificate from DigiCert for $100.  

--

* DigiCert needs to verify your identity so they send you a postcard via snail mail to verify the address of your organization.

--

* You complete the registration and DigiCert gives you a certificate that you can add to your website. 

--

* When people visit your website they will see that DigiCert vouches for your identity.

--

* Certificates are like credit cards!  If you lose one you have to let the CA know otherwise the certificate could be used on a malicious website to deceive your users.

---

## Certificates for Verification

If an organization wants to verify the identity of its users, it will act as a certificate authority.  

--

For Example,

--

* The organization wants to verify users using a more secure method than username and password.

--

* The organization becomes a Certificate Authority and begins issuing certificates to the users of their system.

(P.S.  Anyone can become a Certificate Authority.  Creation of certificates happens via the open source `openssl` library.)

--

* Users provide their certificate to authenticate to organizational systems.

--

(A PEM file used to access AWS is an example of certificate used to authenticate)

---

### What is a Certificate?

--

* A certificate is simply a **public key** with some extra information that can be verified by a private key.*

--

Format of X509 Certificates:
```
Version
Certificate Serial Number
Certificate Algorithm Identifier
Issuer
Validity Period
Subject
Public Key
Certificate Authority Digital Signature
```

## Breaking down a Certificate

### Subject

The name of the computer, user, network device, or service that the CA is vouching for (i.e. launchcode.org or mike@launchcode.org)

### Issuer

This is the Certificate Authority that issued the certificate.

### Public Key

There is a corresponding private key that is used to encrypt all traffic between the sources. 

### Certificate Authority Digital Signature

The Certificate Authority provides a hash of the certificate that can be verified against a public key from that Certificate Authority.

---

View a certificate from a website.

---

## Breaking down a certificate

A `.pem` file is simply a Base64 encoding of a certificate!

View a `.pem` file.

---

## Who to Trust?

### *How do our computers know who to trust?*

--

The world as a whole has already decided who to trust by default.  You can choose to trust more or different Certificate Authorities.

--

Every computer, device, server, or Operating System comes with pre installed certificates of all of the major trusted Certificate Authorities around the world.

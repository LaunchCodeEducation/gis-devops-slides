# SECURITY FOCUS
## Components with Known Vulnerabilities

---
## Security Misconfiguration
--

- [A9 on OWASP top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities)
--

- Dependency heavy development patterns can lead to not understanding which dependencies are used, much less keeping them up to date
--

- Unverified and out of date dependencies can have known/documented vulnerabilities
--

- Attackers will takes the easiest path into a system
--

- You can't get much easier than a known exploit

---
## What is a Component?
--

Components = Dependencies
 - Anything your application needs to run
--

- Language version
--

- Operating system
--

- Web Server / Application Server
--

- Code Libraries (NPM, Maven, Ruby?, Pip)
--

- Databases
--

- Protocols and Procedures (HTTP, weak hash algorithms)

---
## Prevention
--

- Subscribe to security bulletins for all your vendors/dependencies
--

- Have a update plan and schedule
  - Updating OS and libraries should be part of your process
--

- Update as safely and as quickly as you can
  - Make sure new features are configured correctly (OWASP A6)
--

- Verify you don’t have known vulnerabilities (more on this next)

---
## Looking for Vulnerabilities
--

- [Common Vulnerabilties and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/)
--

- [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
--

- [https://www.npmjs.com/advisories](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories)
--

- [https://rubysec.com/](https://rubysec.com/)

---
## Scanning Tools
--

- [OWASP Zap](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project)
  - Passive and Active scanner
  - Spider
  - Brute force tool
  - Fuzzing tool
  - Port scanner
--

- [Retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/)
  - “What you require you must also retire”
  - Find js libraries that have known vulnerabilities

---
## Professional Services

- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io)
  - A company that searches/indexes servers on internet
  - You can pay them to monitor and analyze your systems
  - For example they have a [list of servers](https://www.shodan.io/report/89bnfUyJ) that are still vulnerable to [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed)

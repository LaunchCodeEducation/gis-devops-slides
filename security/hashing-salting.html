# SECURITY FOCUS
## Sensitive Data Exposure

---

## Sensitive Data Exposure
--

- Number 3 on OWASP top 10 for 2017
- [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)
--

- Sensitive data is exposed to the public
--

- Two lines of defense to prevent this
--

  1. Data has to be accessed by attackers
  2. Data has to be readable after accessed

---
## Classify the Data
--

- What defines sensitive in your organization?
--

- What data matches that definition? 
--

- What needs to be kept long term?
--

- Don’t store more data or for longer time periods than needed
  - Use the data and get rid of it
  - It **can't** be leaked if it’s not stored

---
## Limit Access to the Data
--

- Limit access to servers to the absolute minimum
--

- Don't give everyone on the internet a chance to hack your servers
--

- Keep data servers inside a VPN or VPC
--

- Lock down the ports
--

- Don't give every db user access to all tables


---
## Be Strong
--

- If you have sensitive data, take the time to secure it **properly**
--

- Act as if your data will be breached
  - Prepare to make it hard for your data to be used
--

- Do your research
  - Use *strong*, *adaptable* **hashing** algorithms
  - Follow guidelines from security groups like OWASP
  - Use proper key management for **encrypting**

---
## Encryption vs Hashing
--

- Encryption 
  - Is a two way algorithm, uses keys to encrypt and decrypt data
  - Used for sensitive data that needs to be securely stored and also **readable**
--

- Hashing
  - Is a one way algorithm, that turns data into an alternative version in order to hide the true value
  - Used for data(passwords) that will NOT be read in it's original form, but will be stored in your system

---
## Over the Rainbow Table
--

- Hashing passwords by itself is vulnerable to [Rainbow Table attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table)
--

  1. Attackers build a table of hashes from common passwords
  2. Attackers compare leaked password hashes to the Rainbow Table to find matches
  3. When a match is found they see what the "plain text" version of the match is and login with the password  

---
## Add Salt Please
--

- Salting makes Rainbow Tables useless (not all salt processes work exactly like this)
--

1. A truly andom salt is picked for each password change
  2. salt is stored in the database in plain text
  3. hash-algorithm(password + salt) is stored in the database
  4. The resulting stored hash is now more complicated and each password has a different salt added to it
  5. You can no longer use one Rainbow Table to compare with all the leaked passwords

---
## Strong Hashing Algorithms
--

- Don't write your own hashing code
- Find a well maintained library that implements a secure hashing algorithm
- OWASP suggests an adaptive, one way process such as these
  - Argon2[*7] is the winner of the password hashing competition and should be considered as your first choice for new applications;
  - PBKDF2 [*4]
  - scrypt [*5] 
  - bcrypt

# SECURITY FOCUS
## Sensitive Data Exposure

---

## Sensitive Data Exposure
--

- [Number 3 on OWASP top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure) for 2017

--

- Sensitive data is exposed to the public
--

- There are two lines of defense to prevent this:
--

1. Data has to be accessed by attackers
--

2. Data has to be readable after accessed

---
## Classify the Data
--

- What defines sensitive in your organization?
--

- What data matches that definition? 
--

- What needs to be kept long term?
--

- Don’t store more data or for longer time periods than needed
  - Use the data and get rid of it
  - It **can't** be leaked if it’s not stored

---
## Limit Access to the Data
--

- Limit access to servers to the absolute minimum
--

- Don't give everyone on the internet a chance to hack your servers
--

- Keep data servers inside a VPN or VPC
--

- Lock down the ports
--

- Don't give every database user access to all tables


---
## Be Strong
--

- If you have sensitive data, take the time to secure it **properly**
--

- Act as if your data will be breached
  - Prepare to make it hard for your data to be used
--

- Do your research
  - Use *strong*, *adaptable* **hashing** algorithms
  - Follow guidelines from security groups like OWASP
  - Use proper key management for **encrypting**

---
## Encryption vs Hashing
--

- Encryption 
  - Is a two way algorithm, uses keys to encrypt and decrypt data
  - Used for sensitive data that needs to be securely stored and also **readable**
--

- Hashing
  - Is a one-way algorithm, that turns data into an alternative version in order to hide the true value
  - Used for data (passwords) that will NOT be read in it's original form, but will be stored in your system

---

## How Hashing Works

Hashing is enabled via a **hash function**. A hash function `h` has these properties:

- Convert strings into a "hash" of characters: `h(s)` might look something like `b8d08e682534b7a847f174e41f584827`

--

- Similar strings have very different hashes

--

- If `str1` and `str2` are different, then it is _very, very rare_ for `h(str1) == h(str2)` (if this does happen, we say a "collision" has occured)

--

- It is not feasible to "undo" `h` (i.e. we can't find a function `g` so that `g(h(str)) == str` always)

--

- `h` is fast

---
## Strong Hashing Algorithms
--

- Don't write your own hashing code
- Find a well maintained library that implements a secure hashing algorithm
- OWASP suggests an adaptive, one way process such as these
  - Argon2[*7] is the winner of the password hashing competition and should be considered as your first choice for new applications;
  - PBKDF2 [*4]
  - scrypt [*5] 
  - bcrypt

---

## Over the Rainbow Table

--

Hashing passwords by itself is vulnerable to [Rainbow Table attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table)
--

1. Attackers build a table of hashes from common passwords
--

2. Attackers compare leaked password hashes to the Rainbow Table to find matches
--

3. When a match is found they see what the "plain text" version of the match is and login with the password  

---
## Add Salt Please
--

Salting makes Rainbow Tables useless (not all salt processes work exactly like this)
--

1. A truly andom salt is picked for each password change
  2. The salt is stored in the database in plain text
  3. `h(password + salt)` is stored in the database
  4. The resulting stored hash is now more complicated and each password has a different salt added to it
  5. You can no longer use one Rainbow Table to compare with all the leaked passwords

---

## Final Note on Salts 

Some hashing algorithms (such as Bcrypt) have salting built in to them, so a programmer does not need to manually generate and keep track of salts. 

In such cases, the salt will be part of the generated hash string, and does not need to be separately stored in the database.

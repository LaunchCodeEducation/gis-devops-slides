class: center, middle

## What do you (think you) know about Gradle?

---

## Compiling Java Code

Remember this?

--

```nohighlight
$ javac Hello.java
```

<br>

--

Creates a new file `Hello.class` which can be run with:

```nohighlight
$ java Hello
```

---

## Compiling With Dependencies

`Hello.java` (in project root):

```java
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(En.message);
    }
}
```

--

`En.java` (located in `messages/`)

```java
class En {
    public static final String message = "Hello world";
}
```

---

## Compiling With Dependencies

To compile and package `En.java`:

```nohighlight
$ javac En.java
$ jar lib.jar En.class
```
<br>

Creates a `lib.jar` file containing the classfile `En.class`

--

To compile `Hello.java`, which dependes on `lib.jar`:

```nohighlight
$ javac -cp "messages/lib.jar" Hello.java
```
<br>

--

**Whew! This seems like a lot of work! How can we ever manage compiling projects that consist of dozens (or even hundreds!) of classes and external dependencies?!**

---

## Gradle To The Rescue

**Gradle** is a build tool primarily used in Java applications (though usable for other types of projects as well).

<br>

---

## What Gradle Does

- Manages project dependencies (local or remote)

--

- Uses build files written in Groovy

--

- Provides a DSL (domain-specific language) to streamline build config

--

- Is highly extensible via plugins

---

## About Groovy

The Groovy language:

--

* Is object-oriented

--

* Runs on the JVM

--

* Has functional features (incl. closures)

--

* Is "more dynamic" than Java (can change classes via code like in JS)

---

## Gradle vs. Other Build Tools

### Ant and Ivy

**Ant** is a flexible, "opinionless" Java build tool configured via XML. It provides _no dependency management_, and is an Apache project.

--

**Ivy** provides dependency management for Any projects.

--

### Maven

Also an Apache project, **Maven** uses the **project object model** to represent and carry out Java builds (configured via `pom.xml`). It also dictates project structure.

---

## Gradle vs. Other Build Tools

Gradle builds upon concepts of other build tools to provide a better and more flexible build framework.

Important Gradle differentiators:
--

- No XML

--

- Programmatic nature allows for more flexible, expressive configuration (configuration is code)

--

- Allows for multi-project builds

---

## An Example build.gradle File

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
}

mainClassName = 'App'

dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava:23.0'
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

---

## Project Structure

For Java projects, Gradle imposes the Maven project structure:

<br>

![Maven project structure](images/gradle-project-structure.png)

---

## Gradle Components

A Gradle build has several components that can be configured:

- **Tasks** are the fundamental "actions" of a build. They are what we ask Gradle to do for us (e.g. test, build, run, etc)

--

- **Plugins** are extensions that enable project-specific behavior, such as tasks specific to the project type (e.g. `bootRun` is provided by the `'org.springframework.boot'` plugin)

--

- **Dependencies** are the external libraries that your project uses. These can be local (via a JAR) or remote (via a repository)

---

## Tasks

We interact with Gradle via tasks. For example, to run all of the tests in a Java project:

```nohighlight
$ gradle test
```
<br>
--

We can view available tasks this way:

```nohighlight
$ gradle tasks
```
<br>
--

Tasks consist of **configuration** and **action** blocks

---

## Task Actions

Declare and add an action to a task (in `build.gradle`):

```groovy
task hello

hello << {
    println "hello world"
}
```

--

Run the task:

```nohighlight
$ gradle hello
> Task :hello 
hello world
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
```

---

## Task Actions

Task actions are appended:

```groovy
task hello
hello << { println "hello" }
hello << { println "world" }
```
<br>
--

Each block `{ println "hello" }` is an example of a **closure** in Groovy. A closure is essentially an anonymous function. Be giving the `hello` task additional closures, we're telling it to run each function in sequence.

---

## Task Configuration

Before a task executes its action blocks, it executes its **configuration blocks**

```groovy
task hello
hello << { println "hello" }
hello { println "Some setup stuff..." }
```

--

```nohighlight
$ gradle hello
> Task :hello 
> Configure project : 
Some setup stuff...

> Task :hello 
hello

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
```

---

## Where Do Tasks Come From?

--

### Gradle Itself

Gradle comes with some pre-defined tasks: `init`, `wrapper`, `components`, `dependencies`, `help`, and so on... 

--

### Plugins

Tasks may also be provided by plugins. For example, the Java plugin provides: `test`, `build`, `run`, `jar`, `clean`, and many others.

--

### Project-Specific

User-defined tasks, as we just demonstrated.

---

## Dependent Tasks

Tasks can depend on one another.

For example, running `gradle test` in a Java project results in the following tasks being executed:

```nohighlight
:compileJava
:processResources
:classes
:compileTestJava
:processTestResources
:testClasses
:test
```

---

## Task Graph

The full dependency picture is actually more complicated. When executing a task, Gradle must recursively create a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of dependent tasks.

![Task graph](images/task-graph.png)

---

## Creating Dependent Tasks

```groovy
task hello
hello << { println "hello" }

task world { dependsOn hello }
world << { println "world" }
```

Running `gradle world` will result in the `hello` task being run, followed by the `world` task.

---

## Alternatively...

```groovy
task hello << { println "hello" }

task world (dependsOn: hello) << { println "world" }
```

---

## Task Lifecycle Phases

Gradle builds have three lifecycle phases:

* **Initialization**: Decide which projects are supposed to be part of the build (for multi-build projects)

--

* **Configuration**: Tasks are assembled into an internal representation based on dependencies (the task DAG); set up variables and data structures need by task actions. This is when cofiguration blocks are run.

--

* **Execution**: Run build tasks in order. This is when action blocks are run.

---

## Tasks Are Objects

So they have object-like behaviors:

- Tasks have types (by default they are of type `DefaultTask`)

--

- Tasks have methods. The methods of `DefaultTask` are: `dependsOn`, `doFirst`, `doLast`, `onlyIf`

--

- Tasks have properties. The properties of `DefaultTask` are: `didWork`, `enabled`, `path`, `logger`, `logging`, `description`, `temporaryDir`

--

- Tasks can be extended. Some Gradle-provided tasks that you may extend are: `DefaultTask`, `Copy`, `Jar`, `JavaExec`

---

## Plugins

**Plugins** provide a means of adding project-specific behavior to Gradle.

--

Plugins can:

- Add new tasks

--

- Extend core objects (e.g. add new DSL elements)

--

- Apply specific configuration (e.g. add org-specific repositories, non-default build directories, etc)

--

In addition to built-in plugins like `'java'`, plugins are published at [plugins.gradle.org](https://plugins.gradle.org/)

---

## Plugin Usage

To include a plugin in a project:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
    id "com.dorongold.task-tree" version "1.3"
}
```
<br>
--

You may also see the "legacy" DSL syntax from time to time:

```groovy
apply plugin 'java'
```

---

## Dependencies

Projects using the Java plugin may define dependencies.

--

Dependencies:

- May be remote (provided via a repository)

--

- May be local (provided via a JAR)

--

- Are recursively resolved by internal construction of a DAG, to find dependencies dependencies

--

- Have "scope" (more on this in a minute)

--

- Can be viewed by running `gradle dependencies`

---

## Dependency Scope

Each dependency has a **scope** which determines which tasks require it. Tasks specify the scope in which they run.

A scope is a configuration element defined by a plugin.

--

For Java projects, the most commonly used scopes are:

- `compile`
- `runtime`
- `testCompile`
- `testRuntime`
- `archive`

---

## Delcaring Dependencies

```groovy
repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
	compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa')
	compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf')
	compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
	compile(group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.1.4')
	compile('org.springframework.security:spring-security-crypto')
	testCompile('com.h2database:h2')
	runtime('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools')
	testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')
}
```

---

## Resolving Dependencies

One of the most commonly used remote repositories for resolving dependencies is the **Maven Central Repository** at [search.maven.org](https://search.maven.org/)

--

Gradle is able to pull in dependencies from Maven and Ivy repositories.

--

Many organizations host their own internal repositories for publishing and resolving org-specific dependencies

# **12 Factor App**

### A Methodology for building **Cloud Native** Apps

---

## 12 Factor App

The **12 Factor App** methodology was created by Heroku as a series of best practices for deploying apps on the cloud.  

---

## **CloudNative** Applications

### Yes, It's a buzzword.

"Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that fully exploits the advantage of the cloud computing delivery model"

--

What Advantages?

* Nearly limitless computing power

* On demand infrastructure

* Faster time to market through automation

---

## **Cloud Native** vs. Traditional

### A Comparision

--

Traditional - A single server serves an application.

--

**Cloud Native** - Multiple (perhaps 100's) servers serve an application. 

--

### Lifespan

--

Traditional - The application lives on a server for a long time (years).

--

**Cloud Native** - The application could live on a serve for a short time (hours).

--

###Scale

--

Traditional - The bigger server you buy, the more traffic you can handle.

--

**Cloud Native** - You can handle any traffic any time.

---

### The Twelve Factors

1.  Codebase
2.  Dependencies
3.  Config
4.  Backing Services
5.  Build, Release, Run
6.  Processes
7.  Port Binding
8.  Concurrency
9.  Disposability
10. Dev/prod Parity
11. Logs
12. Admin Processes

## Scaling **Twelve Factor Apps**

--

### **Ephemeral** Servers and Non Ephemeral Servers 

--
<br/>

**Ephemeral** Servers are non permanent

* Temporary, "Throw Away" Servers.
* Any server that scales should be ephemeral.

--

<br/>

Non Ephemeral Servers are semi-permanent 

* Don't replace them unless you have to. 
* Your database is non-ephemeral because it is a permanent data store.  

---

## **Ephemeral** by Example

<img src="images/ephemeral_servers.png"></img>

---

## **Ephemeral** == Scalable

1. In order for a machine to scale it needs to be ephemeral.

--

2. Each machine has to look exactly the same at the others.

--

3. Each machine can contain no state.

--

<br>

### Here's how to make it happen.

---

## 4. Backing Services

A **backing service** is any service that is shared among application servers.

* Permanent Datastores - Databases

* Caching and Temporary Storage  - ElasticSearch 

* General Shared Utilities - Sending Email, Message Queues, etc. 

--

### Example

ElasticSearch - Your server could seamlessly interchange a local ElasticSearch and a remote ElasticSearch on AWS.

---

## 6. Stateless Processes

**Stateless Processes** is the "leave no trace* camping principle for servers.

*Note: You can leave a trace, but it won't matter because it might not be there in the next request*

--

<br>

###--> Request Amnesia##
* Each request has a fresh start.  Anything that was on the server last time is gone.

--

Here's why:

--

* Your app is most likely running multiple app servers.  Your request is randomly distributed to any app server. 

--

*Note: When we say stateless, we are referring to the disk.  Memory is except from the stateless rule.

---

## 8. Concurrency

Applications should scale horizonatally.  

--

(This is principle is pretty apparent)

---

## 9. Disposability

Autoscaling means that servers can rapidly be spun up... and down..
--

* Your machine should be ephemeral.  After any request, your machine could be spun down through autocaling.  All state on the machine is lost. 
--

* Conversely, your machine needs to spin up as quickly as possible. Your application can be setup to autoscale, but it is at risk while it is waiting for machines to intialize. 

---

## 11. Logs

Logs are very important piece of state that have to be managed correctly.

--

* Logs fill up hard drives and kill applications.

* Traditionally, logs have been "rotated" (i.e. periodically shipped to another server).

--

### **Twelve Factor** says that logs should never even touch the server.

--

* The best way to handle logs is to treat them as event streams.  

* Logs are treated as event streams and are streamed directly to a log handler like Splunk, Kibana, etc.  

---

## 1. Codebase

Each server should correpsond to one codebase.

--

As applications get bigger...

### **Conway's Law** - The architecture of a codebase eventually mirrors the organizational structure of the teams producing the code. 

--

* Releasing an application becames very complicated if there are the release of several sub applications have to be coordinated. 

--

### This is called the **Monolith**

--

**Twelve Factor** encourages a one to one relationship between an app and an app server.

--

* **Monoliths** can be broken down by extracing code into shareable libraries or microservices. 

---

### **Microservices** are the new library.

A **Microservice** is an application in the form of an API that does one specific task.

--

* Each **Microservice** returns one piece of data that contributes to an overall page or API.

--

* The advantage of microservices over libraries is that APIs can be updated real time.  Libraries require everything to be recompiled.

--

Netflix and Amazon heavily rely on Microservices.  For example:

-- 

* Amazon's "Suggested Products" is a microservice that returns relevant products for a specific user.
* Amazon's Checkout button is a microservice designed specifically for processing orders.
* Amazon's "Reviews" section is a microservice that returns reviews for a product.

---

## 2. Dependencies

An app should contain all of the dependencies required to run.

--

* This means more than just pulling dependencies from Maven and npm.
--

* The app should not depend upon the server for anything.
--

* The app contains everything including the app server.
--

<br>
--

* Modern web app servers like Spring Boot package the web server inside the jar.  `java -jar your-app.jar` is all it takes to run. 

---

## 3. Config


**Twelve Factor** recommends that all configuration and credentials be separated from the code.

--

Configuration and credentials include:

--

* URLs to backing services

--

* Credentials to AWS, Google Maps, Twitter, Facebook, etc.

--

### Treat your app as if it could be open sourced at any point.

--

* Your app will need to function across a variety environments (dev, testing, staging, production).  Each environment will have it's own configuration and credential.

--

**Environment Variables** are considered a best practice for maintaining configuration. 

---

## 5. Build, release, run 

Your app should be built first then released.

--

* Build phase is packaging the app so that it can be deployed on a server

(Remember to include all of the dependencies, including the web server)

--

* A build is an attempt to create a release.  A release can have many builds.

--

* Each release is tagged with a unique number so that it can reerenced in the future.

---

## 7. Port Binding

In traditional infrastructure,  many applications ran on a single machine.  This required carefully mapping ports to each application.

--

In **Cloud Native** applications, one application runs on one machine.  This reduces the complexity of setup.

---

## 12. Admin Processes

Avoid every having to run a script on a server.

--

### **Immutable** environments produce expected results.  Mutable environments potentially produce unexpected results.

--

* When you run a script on a server, you are changing it's internal state.  **Your server should be stateless**.

--

* You may have 20+ servers operating at a time.  How do you ensure that the script runs at the exact same time as the rest of the machines.

--

Solution:

--

* Everytime you need to change a server, throw away the old one and make a new one from scratch.

--

* Create RESTful endpoints to run the task.

--

For example, if you need to reindex Elasticsearch, create an endpoint `/_cluster/reindex` to that performs the reindex task.

---

## 10. Dev / Prod Parity

Each environment (development, testing, staging) should be as similar as possible to production.

--

This means: 

--

* You use the **same** databases.

--

* You use the **same** backing services.

--

* You use the **same** server configuration.

--

* They're all backing services.  Just swap out the URL to a dev or staging service.

--

### Unit tests help prevent errors in logic.  Full integration tests check **everything else**.

---

## 10. Dev / Prod Parity (cont)


Environments:

--

* **Production** - this is the real deal.  You can't test or even access this system.  Everything has to be perfect.

--

* **Staging** - this system is a mirror image of production.  You are working with a copy of live data.

--

* **Test** - this system checks that everyone's code works correctly **together**.

--

* **Development** - this is your local environment.

---

## 10. Dev/Prod Parity (cont)

### Errors in production are tough to **track down**  and cause **data loss**. 

--

**Every step** has to be automated.

--

* Ideally, the setup script that you use on your local environment is exactly the same the setup script that you use for production.

--

* You will likely  hand off packaged code to run on a machine that you will never touch.  **That's why DevOps is so important**.

* You will need to script your deployment so that you can have confidence it will run correctly on production.

---

### Which of the **The Twelve Factors** principles does Airwaze meet?

**Codebase** - *one app from one codebase.* 
--

* ✅ Good! The Airwaze codebase produces one artifact that is deployed on one server.

--

**Dependencies** - *the app has **everything** it needs to run* 

--

* ✅  Good! SpringBoot packages a the TomCat webserver into the executable jar file.

--

**Config** - *credentials, URLS, etc. can **easily be changed** for each environment*  

--

* ✅  Good!  Airwaze has a `application.properties` for Dev and a `application-test.properties` for test. 

--

* ❗ Improve.  The URL, username, and password of our app are hard coded. Ideally, these should be environment variables. 

---

### Which of the **The Twelve Factors** principles does Airwaze meet?

**Backing Services** - *functionality your app depends on should be bound by a URL* 

--

* ✅  Good! The database can easily be swapped out for a database on another machine by inputting a different URL.


--

* ❗ Improve. ElasticSearch is embedded and cannot easily be swapped out for another machine. 

--

**Build, Release, Run** - *code is built and released before runnig on the server*

--

* ✅  Good! Code is built and packaged as a jar using Gradle.

--

* ❗ Improve. We should assign a unique ID to each packaged jar so that it can be tracked back to the commit. 

---

**Processes** - *servers run as stateless processes.  i.e **request amnesia** *

--

* ✅  Good! While the app server is running, nothing is accessed from the file system. 

--

**Port Binding** - *servers can be bound to any port... typically one port per server*

--

* ✅  Good! Airwaze can even have the port configured via an environment variable. 

--

**Concurrency** - *applications scale **horizontally**... instead of servers getting bigger*

--

* ✅  Good! We have multiple servers behing an ELB. 

--

* ❗ Improve. Currently our servers do not scale up if traffic increases. 

---

**Disposability** - *servers can be spun up and thrown away **quickly***

--

* ✅  Good! Airwaze stores nothing on the local file system.  SpringBoot spins up in under a minute. 

--

**Dev/prod Parity** - *dev, test, and staging closely **mirror** production*

--

* ❗ Improve. Currently, we have to manually configure a new environment.  It should be automatically spun up.  

--

**Logs** - *logs are treated like output streams and are **never** stored on the server*

--

* ❗ Improve. Currently logs are stored on the machine. These logs should immediately be streamed to a log server. 

--

**Admin Processes** - *never run scripts on a machine, instead create an API endpoint*

--

* ✅ Good!  We can reuse our `reindex` elasticsearch  REST endpoint from Zika on our airwaze app.

# Intro to Amazon Web Services

---

### A Brief History of Amazon Web Services

*AWS was born out of a startup struggling to stay on top of massive demand.*

* In the early 2000s, Amazon was building infrastructure and tools to support Amazon.com.
* In 2006, Amazon brought their tools and infrastructure public with EC2.
* They were the first company to make a public cloud offering.
* Currently AWS control 35% of the cloud market.
* AWS offers 98 different products.

## AWS Acronyms

**EC2** These are virtualized Linux, Windows, and Mac comupters that you rent from Amazon.
* Amazon gives you an IP address and SSH access to the computer.

**S3**  Cloud storage. Imagine a virtual, cloud file system. 
* Amazon gives you a access to a RESTful API that is used to store pretty much anything you want.

**RDS** Database.  High availability databases in any flavor you like (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, MariaDB).
* Amazon gives you either an internally facing or externally facing IP address to connect to.

---

## Why AWS?

You have options:
--

* AWS
--

* Google Cloud
--

* Microsoft Azure
--

* DigitalOcean
--

* Linode

--

* hundreds more
--

### People choose because it is the **complete tool** for **highly available** systems.

---

## AWS High Availability

AWS has an uptime of **99.95%**.

### **99.95%** uptime is about **4 hours** of downtime a year.

--

*4 hours of downtime is not good enough for most companies*.

---

## AWS Redundancy

Reducing the the points of failure by creating failover backup systems.

--

* You can achieve even higher uptime by distributing your systems across  "Availability Zones."

--

* Amazon has 52 Availability Zones across the globe.  Each "AZ" is independently powered and cooled.  Each has its own networking and security. 

--

* AWS does most of this behind the scenes!

---

## AWS: **Complete** Toolset

AWS gives you everything that you would normally have in a data center and more:

* Easy to configure system access and security (**IAM**)

* Fine grained network security (**VPC**)

* Auto scaling servers (**Elastic Beanstalk**)

* Remote permanent storage (**S3**)

--

### AWS makes it "easy" to build out a resilient cloud application.
*(it's a lot of work to build out these tools on your own)*

---

## **AWS** by Example

* How does AWS make things easy for the developer?

* How does AWS help your systems scale?

---

## **AWS** by Example

Single Server Application
<img src="images/simple_single_server.png"></img>

---

## **AWS** by Example

EC2 Server Simply Overwhelmed
<img src="images/simple_server_simply_overwhelmed.png"></img>

---

## **AWS** by Example

### Single Server Situation

As traffic increases, having one server causes problems:

* Eventually the server reaches peak utilization and has to be upgraded.
* Since the one server is running both the web application and the database (and perhaps more) a performance problem on one system brings down everything.
* The single server is a point of failure.  If that server goes down, the applciation and all of the data goes with it! 

---

## **AWS** by Example

### The **Solution**

**RDS** Database

* An **RDS** database is simply an specialized EC2 instance that has Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, or MariaDB installed.

* **RDS** databases have a few extra perks.  

* An **RDS** database has **high availability**.  This means that behind the scenes AWS automatically creates multiple copies of your database in different data centers.  If one data center goes down, your database is still up.

---

## **AWS** by Example

Server with a separate Database

**Warning!** The communication between the web application and the database is not encrypted!

<img src="images/simple_server_with_database_not_encrypted.png"></img>

---

## **AWS** by Example 

### Cloud Security

* Traditional data centers protect data with physical security and firewalls.

* In the cloud, **EVERYTHING** is potentially open to the public.

--

###Solution

* VPN networks can encrypt data moving across a group of computers.

*OR*

* AWS offers a **VPC** Virtual Private Cloud that acts as a data center around your cloud infrastructure.

---

## **AWS** by Example

### Virtual Private Clouds

* **VPC**s are logically separated from all other virtual networks on AWS.

* **VPC**s create a virtual network on the cloud that is invisible to the rest of the internet.

* Since the network is invisibile to the outside world, the data is generally* safe to travel unencryped between devices. 

---

## **AWS** by Example

EC2 Server with a database in a VPC
<img src="images/simple_server_with_database_vpc.png"></img>

---

## **AWS** by Example

As the app traffic increases, the load on the server increases. 

The increased load can cause system failures resulting in downtime.

### Solution

Elastic Load Balancers
* ELBs distribute traffic across multiple servers.

* ELBs are smart.  They continuously check on their servers.  If a server goes down, it reroutes traffic to other servers in the group.

* ELBs are also **High Availability**.  Essentially, they will almost never go down.

---

## **AWS** by Example

**EC2** Server behind an **ELB** using an **RDS** database within a **VPC**

---

## **AWS** by Example

Keep scaling as many **EC2** instances as you need!

---

## **Troubleshooting** TCP Connections

If you want to keep your sanity while setting up your VPC, you need to know how to **troubleshoot** TCP connections.

--

TCP Connections in one of the following states:

1.  Connected üôå
2.  Connection Refused üòê
3.  Connection Timeout üò•

--

Each message is a hint as to what is wrong!

---

## **Troubleshooting** TCP Connections

### Telnet

**Telnet** is a tool that allows you to communicate with other computers over TCP.

--

* Telnet can also be used to check the status of TCP connections:
```
$ telnet {ip address} {port}
```

---

## **Troubleshooting** TCP Connections

### Connected üôå

```
$ telnet localhost 8000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

* The port is open.

* The server is running and properly accepting responses. 

---

## **Troubleshooting** TCP Connections

### Connection Refused üòê

```
$ telnet 159.89.182.183 9001
Trying 159.89.182.183...
telnet: connect to address 159.89.182.183: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host
```
* The port is open.

* There is nothing running on the port to accept the incoming connection.

---

## **Troubleshooting** TCP Connections

### Connection Timeout üò• 

```
$ telnet 159.89.182.183 9002
Trying 159.89.182.183...
```

* The port is not open.

* A server may running, but the connection is being blocked.

* Check the firewall to see if traffic is allowed.

---
--- 

## A Word about **Ports**

Ports accept TCP connections for your computer.

* All TCP connections that come into your computer arrive on a **Port**. 

* There are 65,535 ports on your computer.

--

The 65,535 ports on your computer are in three groups:

1. **Well Known Ports** (0-1023) - Specifically allocated by IANA.  Example - 22 is SSH, 25 - SMTP, 80 - HTTP, 443 - HTTPS. 
2. **Registered Ports** (1024-49151) - There can be registered with IANA.  Considered "Semi Reserved." 
3. **Ephemeral Ports** (49152-65535) - Programs are free to use these ports any time they want.

---

## A Word about **Ports**

### How it works

* Known Ports - Certain programs are known to run a specific port so - there can never be another process using that port.

* Ports are used to listen for connections.

* When the incoming connection comes in, the computer moves their conversation to an ephemeral port so that the it can continue listening on original port.

---

## Port Example

* You ssh into a server at port 22.

* The server accepts your connection and says "Hey want to chat on port 61,928?"

* Your computer says "Sure!".  Both computers talk over port 61,928.

### It's important to remember to open the ephemeral ports when configuring a firewall###

# SECURITY FOCUS
## Broken Authentication
### (AKA Bad Passwords and Login policies)

---
## Cracking
--

- Brute-force attack that guesses repeatedly
--

- The attack could literally try to login to the application repeatedly (if no checks prevent it)
--

- Or guessing are repeated against known hashed passwords from a data breach

---
## Your Data has been Leaked

---
## Fortune Favors the Hackers
--

- The deck is currently stacked in the attacker's favor
--

- Enterprise software vendors haven't moved to stronger hash types
--

- Moore's law has helped attackers tremendously
--

- Existing defenses (password policies) have lead to exploitable predictability
--

- pass-the-hash attacks, which can make password cracking unnecessary

---
## Strong Passwords 
--

- The oldies but goodies
- At least 1 uppercase character (A-Z)
- At least 1 lowercase character (a-z)
- At least 1 digit (0-9)
- At least 1 special character (punctuation) â€” do not forget to treat space as special characters too
- Not more than 2 identical characters in a row (e.g., 111 not allowed)

---
## Strong Passwords P2
--

- At least 10 characters
- At most 128 characters (don't have a small max)
--

- Long passwords can increase cracking time from hours to billions of years
--

- Check passwords against a list of known weak passwords (don't allow if found)

---
## Password Topology
--

- Predictable user behavior is BAD for security
  - WeakSauce@2018 -> WeakSauce@2018!
  - Oct0b3r! -> N0v3mb3r! -> D0c3mber!
--

- Attackers can reduce cracking time by focusing on known user behaviors and patterns
--

- Ban commonly used password topologies
--

- Force users to change topologies with each new password (more on these next)

---
## Failed Logins
--

- Failed login messages should NOT indicate which part of the login was incorrect
--

- Limit the amount of failed logins during a certain time frame

---
## Further Suggestions
--

- Two Factor Authentication
  - Absolutely use it when possible
--

- Password Managers
  - Security comunity is mixed
  - if they lead to longer, safer, less predictable passwords then they are ok

---
## The End

- Now let's all go change our passwords

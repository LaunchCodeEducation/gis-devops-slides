# Intro to Dev Ops

---

### A Brief History of Ops

In the past, Hardware was:
* Very expensive
* Ran onsite in data centers
* Required months of lead to planning and acquisition
* Required significant expertise to configure, monitor, and maintain
* Scaled vertically (bigger machines)

####This naturally led to an `Ops` team.
* System administrators
* Upgraded systems
* Planned for capacity
* Kept systems running

### A Brief History of Ops

However, starting in the early 2000s computing began to change:
* Computing began to scale horizontally (more machines)
* New Way:  If you needed more memory, CPU, etc. you added another machine.
* (Old Way:  If you needed more memory, CPU, etc. you threw away your current machine and bought a bigger one)

### A Brief History of Ops

With horizontally scalable computing power, it then became possible to:
* Build systems that can accommodate massive scale
* Share / Rent your computational capacity to others

### In 2006, Amazon launched the EC2 and S3 product.
* Amazon had developed significant computational power for serving Amazon.com
* EC2 allowed you to rent a virtualized machine that ran on their infrastructure

---

### A Brief History of Ops

Amazon EC2 (and similiar products) were the start of Cloud Computing.

Cloud Computing was a game changer because:
* Virtualized computers could be rented from systems that scale horizontally.
* Virtualized computers are on demand.
* Virtualized computers are cheap because they use commodity hardware.
* Virtualized computers are hands off because they run in a remote data center.
* Virtualized computers are (relatively) easier to configure as a single machine.
* Virtualized computers have APIs which means that you can write code to spin up a machine.

### DevOps puts the developer in the Operations

Cloud Virtualized Computing made operations accessible to the developer.

DevOps is a culture of developers working close to operations.

This is good for the developer because:
* You no longer have to wait on operations to provide hardware.
* You can more easily identify bugs because you can exactly replicate a production environment.
* You can design your systems for scalability from the beginning.

### DevOps in the Workplace

Developers are encouraged to own the lifecycle of their application.

* The app that you write locally needs to be deployable on a server.
* The app that you write locally also needs to go through a series of checks:
** All tests need to pass.
** All linters need to pass.
** All security checks need to pass.
* The app that you write locally needs to be able to scale under load.
* When there is a problem with your app, you will need to be able to discover the issue.

### This Week

You will be learning how to manage your app's pipeline.

1. Basic Operations - How to deploy an app on a remote server and troubleshoot issues.
2. Operations in a Cloud Environment - How to deploy apps that are secure and scale in the cloud.
3. Best Practices of Cloud Operations - How to make your deployed app as simple and reliable as possible.
4. Build Systems - How to build your project. 
5. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment - Building the deployment pipeline for yor app.

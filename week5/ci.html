# Continous Integration

---

## Continous Integration

--

* Is all about code and human communication
--

* What was built 
--

* Did it pass tests
--

* When was it deployed
--

* What version can we roll back to


---
## Important Software Dev Goals
--

* Quick feedback
--

* Stable code base
--

* Short releases
--

* Improve quality
--

* Reduce risk
--


---

## Continuous Deployment
--

* Is the ability to automatically deploy software to different environments
--

* All stages happen automatically, all the way through staging and production


---
## Continuous Delivery
--

* One step back from Continous *Deployment*
--

* With every merge into `master` we *deliver* an artifact that *can* be deployed
--

* More steps have to be done to actually deploy te artifact (example artifcat: .jar file)
--

* Every “check-in” is ready to/could be released to production
--


---
## Jenkins
* TBD

# Continuous Integration



---
## Continuous Integration
###Aims to improve the quality of software
###and reduce the amount of effort needed to deliver it



---
## How do we do that?
###By applying quality control and integration testing early and often
###Instead of doing those after ALL the development has been done


---

## Communication and Integration

--

* Is all about code and human communication/coordination
--

* What was built 
--

* Did it pass tests
--

* When was it deployed
--

* Get feedback from client
--

* What version can we roll back to if something blows up


---
## Important Software Dev Goals

--
* Keep build time <= 10 minutes (per project)
--

* Simple deployment to different environments
--

* Quick feedback
--

* Stable code base
--

* Short releases
--

* Improve quality
--

* Reduce risk
--

* Automated Tests!


---

## Continuous D Words
--

###Continuous <span class="special">Deployment</span> 
--

##VS
--

###Continuous <span class="special">Delivery</span>



---

## Continuous <span class="special">Deployment</span>
--

* Is the ability to automatically deploy software to different environments
--

* All stages happen automatically, all the way through staging and production


---
## Continuous <span class="special">Delivery</span>
--

* One step back from Continuous *Deployment*
--

* With every merge into `master` we <span class="underline">deliver</span> an artifact that <span class="underline">can</span> be deployed
--

* More steps have to be done to actually deploy te artifact
--

* Every “check-in” is ready to/could be released to production
--


---
## Jenkins
* Open source software that is used for Continuous Integration
--

* Is installed on a server and used by ops/dev/qa
--

* Will clone your repo, build, test, package, lint, deliver, deploy...

---
## Jenkins Terminology
--

* Project - Example: Airwaze Compile project that will build your code
--

* Workspace - The directory where files for a project are stored. Usually a cloned repo.
--

* Plugins - Projects used plugins: git, junit, aws (there are plugins for everything)
--

* View - Simply a configurable list of projects (useful if you have lots of projects)
--

* Build History - List of previous project builds and the results from them
--

* Downstream Projects - Happen after this project
* Upstream Projects - Happen before this project

    # Day 3
    ### Integration Testing
    
    ---
    
    ## Testing Review
    
    Unit Test
    * Test the smallest unit of code in isolation

    TDD & Red, Green, Refactor
    * Write tests first
    * Write minimal code to get test to pass
    * Clean up the code
    * Get all tests to pass
    
    ---

    ## Unit Tests Are Not Alone
    
    Integration Tests
    * Testing the integrated parts of a feature
    * All the units and layers combined to make a feature
    * What is being integrated differs for each language, framework, and application purpose
   
    ---

    ## Acceptance Tests
    * You app is ran in enviroment as close as possible to live enviroment (possibly staging)
    * App is used as end user will. Inputs are filled in, buttons are clicked
      * Tools like selenium are configured on what to click and input
    * Expected behavior is verified by inspecting the output of the app
      * Verify HTML
      * Inspect JSON
      * File was created correctly
      * Anything that the app returns, creates, or displays
    
    ---
    
    ## Integration Tests

    * It is important to be able to test that all these work together
      * POJOS
      * controllers
      * models
      * views
      * database connection
      * database queries

    ---

    ## Spring Integration Tests

    * Offer a way to test all the layers WITHOUT...
      * booting up your webserver
      * deploying your code
      * opening a browser and manually testing

    * The Spring framework provides many utilities
      * Annotations
      * Classes
      * Depedency Injection of test versions of resources (Controllers, Models, Properties...)

# Gitlab
## Day 1: Lesson 1

---

## Gitlab.com

* Web application for managing and collaborating on git repos
--

* Very similar to github
--

* You can host your own gitlab inside your own network
--

* That is appealing security focused organizations

---

## Gitlab compared to Github

* Pull Requests are called Merge Requests
* You can have private projects for free accounts
* We are using a free repo for our work in this class
* There are a few other minor differences, but nothing that should cause you any confusion
* For a detailed list of differences [here](https://about.gitlab.com/comparison/)

---

## Gitlab user roles

* You can add users to projects and groups with a certain role
* Owner, Master - Can do pretty much anything
* Developer - Can clone, pull, push, comment, approve merge requests
* Reporter - Can clone and comment

---

## Gitlab Setup

1. Go to gitlab.com in your web browser
2. Create an account (create **new one** or create **using Github account**)
3. Create an SSH key by following [these instructions](https://gitlab.com/help/ssh/README)
4. Have instructor add you to certain groups
5. Browser around the gitlab.com: groups, projects, settings...
6. Clone a repo to make sure everything is setup correctly

---

## Git command review

* fork a repo - no a git command for this, but very useful
* git clone https://repo-url
* git status
* git checkout branch-name
* git add *
* git commit -m "a most accurate message"
* git push
* git pull
* git fetch

---

## Git walkthrough

Follow along with instructor as we refresh our git skills

---

## Intellij Refresher
 * What version do you have installed?
 * What JDK do you have installed?
 * more really useful stuff...

---

## Java Project Structure Conventions

* Where to put stuff and why...

---

## Refactoring

* Changing code without changing its external behavior
* Whey do you want to do this?
* Better techniques come along
* New libraries are discovered
* The code is “bad”
  * Duplication
  * Bad naming conventions

---

## Examples of Refactoring

* Renaming classes or methods
* Moving methods to a different class
* Moving classes to a different package
* Using a new sorting algorithm
* Using a feature in the language, that the previous coder didn’t know about

---

## After a Refactor

* How do we know everything still work?
* We can give it the ol eye ball test... Looks good to me. Ship it!
* Manually test the application a few times
* Run the automated tets!

---

## Automated Testing

Automated tests are code files that utilize all the features of your code
* Your classes are instantiated
* The methods are executed
* All in specific order to insure they all do what they are supposed to

---

## Benefits of Automated Tests

* They verify that the code functions as it should
  * All good here
  * Oops, I just broke something with that last change
* The tests themselves are documentation on what the code should do
  * Because the tests demonstrate proper usages of the code
  * With all the required inputs and expected outputs
* Unlike in code comments the tests can’t become stale
  * Tests will fail if the code behavior changes

---

## Unit Test

A specific type of automated test.
What is a “unit”?
* The smallest testable unit of work
  * Most likely that is a function, but not always
* A single, clearly stated, desired behavior
  * Breaking it down this way makes is easier to find bugs when issues arise

---

## Unit of Work Examples

A single, clearly stated, desired behavior
* Method returns false if passed an empty array
* Method throws exception if passed a negative number
* Class constructor properly creates object when passed required parameters

---

## Best Practices

* Test should be deterministic
  * Given the same starting state, the test will always have the same result
  * A test that passes “most of the time” is not a good test.
* Grouped together properly
  * Don’t test totally unrelated things in the same test method or even the same test file
* Tests should pass before committing code
* Don’t test getters and setters

---

## Writing a Unit Test

The AAA's method helps to guide us
* Arrange
  * Variables that you will need
* Act
  * Call method(s)
* Assert
  * Check for specific results

---

## Unit Test Components

* Test
  * A single test function
* Fixture
  * A class file containing one or more test functions
* Test Runner
  * A library that executes the tests and provides a report
  * For us this will be a library called JUnit

---

## JUnit

A Java library that provides classes, methods, and assertions for organizaing and executing unit tests.

---

## JUnit Annotations

* @Fixture
* @Test
* @Before
* @After
* @BeforeClass
* @AfterClass

---

## Instructor Led Walkthrough

1. Fork this repo https://gitlab.com/LaunchCodeTraining/car-unit-tests-starter
2. Clone your version locally
3. Review the classes
4. Run the Main class 
5. Start completing the TODO comments with the instructor

# Day 1
### Git, Gitlab, Intellij, Unit Testing

---

## Gitlab

* Is an open source **git repository** manager
--

* You can install it yourself and have your own "gitlab", [see this](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/) 
--

* Or you can use [gitlab.com](gitlab.com) in a similar way you would use github.com
--

---

## Gitlab compared to Github
--

* Gitlab is open source and you can setup your own internal gitlab
--

* Pull Requests are called Merge Requests
--

* Free accounts can have private repos (Gitlab.com compared to Github.com)
--

* There are a few other minor differences, but nothing that should cause you any confusion
* For a detailed list of differences see [https://about.gitlab.com/comparison/](https://about.gitlab.com/comparison/)

---

## Gitlab user roles

* You can add users to projects and groups with a certain role
* Owner, Master - Can do pretty much anything
* Developer - Can clone, pull, push, comment, approve merge requests
* Reporter - Can clone and comment

---

## Gitlab Setup

1. Go to gitlab.com in your web browser
2. Create an account (create **new one** or create **using Github account**)
3. Create an SSH key by following [these instructions](https://gitlab.com/help/ssh/README) (DON'T enter a pass phrase when prompted. Hit enter.)
4. Send your gitlab username to the instructor so you can be added to certain groups
5. Browse around the gitlab.com: groups, projects, settings...
6. Clone a repo to make sure everything is setup correctly

---

## How Will We Use Git

- Via terminal, without the aid of a GUI
- Why you ask?
--

- Because it helps the git process to really sink in
--

- Also we will create **feature branches** for our work
- These will help keep our code organized
--

- When to create a new branch?
  - New assignment
  - Trying something out (experiment)

---

## Git command review
--

* fork a repo - not an actual git command for this, but very useful
--

* git clone https://repo-url
--

* git status
--

* git checkout branch-name
--

* git add * or git add . `or` git add specific-filename.txt
--

* git commit -m "a most accurate message"

---

## More Git Commands

* git push
--

* git pull
--

* git fetch
--

* git branch `and` git branch -a
--
* gite remote
--

* git remote show origin
--

* git remote add upstream url-of-a-repo

---

## Git walkthrough

- [https://education.launchcode.org/gis-devops/walkthroughs/gitLab/index.html#walkthrough-gitlab)

---

## Intellij Refresher
--

* We will use Intellij Community Edition (It's free!)
--

* We will also use JDK 8
--

* Create a new project
* Check JDK version in Intellij
* Mark folders as src, test, lib, excluded...
* Run your code
* Run your tests
* How to save files (they save automatically unless you turn that off)

---

## Intellij Tips
--

* Ctrl Enter - Generate menu
--

* Command shift o - Search for file
--

* Command e - recently opened files
--

* Command j - shows you a shorcut menu
--

* Command shift - and + - expands for collapses code folding
--

* Command / - adds // comment in front of selected lines (removes if already present)
--

* Alt + Enter - Intentions menu (offers to solve problems for you)
--


---

## Intellij Tips pt2
--

* Open multiple files by splitting vertically or horizontally
--

* Middle click or CMD click to go to source of a class or method
--

* Show/hide method parameter name hints
--

* Local history for a file - log of changes Intellij keeps (right click a file)
--

* Do you have any tips you want to share?

---

## Java Project Structure Conventions
--

* lib - contains jar files
* out/build - the compiled class files
* src
  * main - java sources files
  * test - test java source files

---

## Refactoring
--

* Changing code without changing its external behavior
* When do you want to do this?
--

* Better techniques come along
--

* New requirements must be met
--

* The presence of "code smells"
  * Duplication
  * Bad naming conventions

---

## Examples of Refactoring
--

* Renaming classes or methods
--

* Moving methods to a different class
--

* Moving classes to a different package
--

* Using a new sorting algorithm
--

* Using a feature in the language, that the previous coder didn’t know about
--

* Validation rules need to change based on new requirements

---

## After a Refactor

* How do we know everything still work?
--

* We can give it the ol eye ball test... Looks good to me. Ship it!
--

* Manually test the application a few times... I don't see any bugs. Ship it!
--

* Run the automated tests!... uh oh that thing I forgot about is broken :(

---

---

## Automated Testing
--

Automated tests are code files that utilize all the features of your code
--

* Your classes are instantiated
--

* Certain methods are executed (hopefully most of them)
--

* All in specific order to insure they all do what they are supposed to

---

## Benefits of Automated Tests
--

* They verify that the code functions as it should
  * All good here
  * Oops, I just broke something with that last change
--

* The tests themselves are documentation on what the code should do
  * Because the tests demonstrate proper usages of the code
  * With all the required inputs and expected outputs
--

* Unlike in code comments the tests can’t become stale
  * Tests will fail if the code behavior changes

---

## Unit Test

A specific type of automated test.
--

What is a “unit”?
--

* The **smallest testable** unit of work
  * Most likely that is a function, but not always
--

* A single, clearly stated, desired behavior
  * Breaking it down this way makes is easier to find bugs when issues arise

---

## Unit of Work Examples

A single, clearly stated, desired behavior
--

* Method returns false if passed an empty array
--

* Method throws exception if passed a negative number
--

* Class constructor properly creates object when passed required parameters

---

## Best Practices
--

* Test should be deterministic
--

  * Given the same starting state, the test will always have the same result
  * A test that passes “most of the time” is not a good test.
--

* Grouped together properly and focused
  * Don’t test totally unrelated things in the same test method or even the same test file
--

* Tests should pass before committing code
--

* Don’t test getters and setters

---

## Writing a Unit Test
--

The AAA's method helps to guide us
--

* Arrange
  * Variables that you will need
--

* Act
  * Call method(s)
--

* Assert
  * Check for specific results

---

## Unit Test Components
--

* Test
  * A single test function
--

* Fixture
  * A class file containing one or more test functions
--

* Test Runner
  * A library that executes the tests and provides a report
  * For us this will be a library called JUnit

---

## JUnit

A Java library that provides classes, methods, and assertions for organizaing and executing unit tests.
--

- Specifcally JUnit 4
--

- Why not JUnit 5? For some reason the Java testing community has not widely adopted it *yet*

---

## JUnit Annotations
--

* @Fixture
--

* @Test
--

* @Before
--

* @After
--

* @BeforeClass
--

* @AfterClass

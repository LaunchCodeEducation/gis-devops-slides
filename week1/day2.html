* A link to agile slides or a summary of the info here

## Building Your Application

What does it take to build your application?
* Your Java code has to be compiled
* Finding and organizing code files you didn’t write (third party files)
* CSS, HTML, and JavaScript if you are making a web app
* Misc files: csv, database, settings...

---

## Third Party Libraries

* Have to be downloaded and referenced in your code  
* Could be...
  * Common logic used by all your team’s projects
  * Third party libraries for
      * Charts
      * Database framework
      * MVC framework
      * etc

---

## Transivite Dependencies

Some libraries require other libraries to work
* You want to use library A
  * Library requires library B and C
  * You have to include libraries A, B and C in your project
* This can be hard to manage when you use a lot of libraries
* Also keeping your libraries up to date is tedious

---

## Build Artifacts

* File or files that result form your project being built
* .class files compiled by javac command
* .jar files created by jar commnad
* misc other files
* run your tests

---

## Hello Gradle

* Manages your project artifacts
  * The files created when your project is built
    * Jar files, War files
  * Artifacts can also be any type of file

---

## More Gradle

* Manages Dependencies (libraries)
  * Correct version of the library
  * Transitive libraries
  * Dependency conflict resolution
  * Repository where libraries are stored
    * All the jar files have to be stored somewhere
    * A repository catalogs the libraries by name and version

---

## How to Configure Gradle

* Add tasks in build.gradle
* Use plugins
  * Java plugin - apply plugin: "java"
  * Test plugin
  * [default plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/standard_plugins.html]
  * [third party plugins](https://plugins.gradle.org/)
* Put your source files in the right places

---

## How to use Gralde with Intellij

* You can create a project with Gradle ready to use
* Shows gradle tasks in a special window
* Shows dependencies listed in the gradle file
* You can search for and add dependencies via Generate command
* Going forward we will use gradle for our Java projects

---

## Gradle Resources

* [Udacity videos about gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html)
* [https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/index.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/index.html)

---

## TDD

* Test Driven Development
  * Write tests before implementing the story in working code
* Steps
  * Write a test
  * Run the tests (they will fail)
  * Write the code (that makes the tests pass)
  * Refactor the code
  * Run tests again
  * Repeat

---

## Think About Your Task

You will have to think through your code before spending hours writing it
* What methods and classes will I need?
* What parameters will be needed for your method(s)
* What will the method(s) return?
* What dependencies will be needed in your class(es)
* Could exceptions be thrown?

---

## TDD Benefits
* Clean, clearly defined code due to focus on discrete aspects
* Find design roadblocks earlier
* Already have confidence that your code “works”
* Tests help define what your code is supposed to do
* Some believe if done right you will not need to use a debugger

---

## Instructor walk through
* Add features to [car repo]
(https://gitlab.com/LaunchCodeTraining/car-unit-tests-starter)
* car.refuel(int gasAmount) - Should throw exception if you fill it past full
* car.drive(int miles) - should return a bool if all distance was traveled
* what else can we do?

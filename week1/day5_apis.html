# Day 5
### HTTP

---

## HTTP

* Message protocol that is the foundation of the internet.
--

* Hypertext Transfer Protocol was designed for transferring hypertext (html).

--

* (It transfer much more than hypertext ... javascript, css, video, images, etc.)

---

## Imagine you had ask a robot for a webpage in 1997

---

## Meet Charlie the Robot
![Charlie|250x250](charlie-the-robot.jpg)
* Charlie only speaks HTTP

---

## A few things to know about Charlie the Robot

* Request Response - You request a resource.  It returns the resource.  That's it.
* Structured Requests - Just like mailing a letter, there is specific data that you have to put in specific places.
* Number Codes - The robot does not know any words. It just returns resources and numbers.

---

## Request Response

* When you type `http://localhost:63342/gis-devops-slides/week1/day5.html`, the browser produces this request:

```

* HTTP Verb - GET, POST, DELETE, UPDATE, etc.
* HTTP Headers - Options of how you would like the data handled, message sent, authenticated, etc..
* HTTP Body - "Letter in the Envelope".  (Not present for GET since you're just requesting data)

---

## HTTP Verbs

* HTTP Verbs provide a standardized way to request actions from a server.
* GET    - Retrieve a resource.
* POST   - Save a resource.
* PUT    - Replace a resource.
* DELETE - Delete a resource
* HEAD   - "Says Hello"
* CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH

---

## HTTP Message Body

* HTTP Message Body is the content that you actually trying to transfer.  ***Nearly all HTTP responses will have a Message Body***.

A message body is only required on an HTTP request when attempting to update data on the server.
* GET    - None.
* POST   - Message body is content to save on server.
* PUT    - Message body is content to replace on a server.
* DELETE - None
* HEAD   - None

---

## HTTP Message Headers

* HTTP Message Headers allow you to provide additional context to the server about the request.
* Accept            - The content type that the client is expecting.
* Content-Type      - The content type that the client is specifically requesting.
* Accept-Language   - The language the client wants content in.
* Cookie            - Data ther server is able to persist between requests.
* User-Agent        - What type of device the cilent is so that content is appropriate.
* Authorization     - A shared secret key between the client and server to access secured content.
* ... there's about 30 more ...

The following is an example response.
```
Status Code:304 Not Modified
content-type:text/html
date:Tue, 16 Jan 2018 00:21:20 GMT

## HTTP Message Response Redux

* Status Code  - Message about how the request was processed.
* Message Body - Contains the content which could be an image, video, HTML, JSON, XML, etc.
* Headers      - Information about the requested data.

---

## HTTP Status Codes

To tell you about the operation, the server communicates in numbers grouped by relevancy
* 1xx - Purely Informational
* 2xx - Success
* 3xx - Redirection
* 4xx - Client Error ("you messed up")
* 5xx - Server Error ("server messed up")

---

## Essential Status Codes

* 200 - Successful Request
* 201 - Resource created
* 301 - Moved Permanently
* 400 - Bad Request
* 401 - Unauthorized
* 404 - Not Found
* 500 - Internal Server Error
* 503 - Server Unavailable (aka melting)

---

## Message Body - json

* json - javascript object notation
* arrays and maps holding data ... with a few exceptions
    * in json, keys in a map must be written with double quotes
    * in json, values can be represented as a string, number, json object, an array, boolean, or null.
    * use json.parse to convert json into workable javascript.

```
var json = {"key1": "value1", "key2": ["option1", "option2"]}
var javascriptmap = json.parse(json);
console.log(javascriptmap.key2[1]);  // "option2"
```

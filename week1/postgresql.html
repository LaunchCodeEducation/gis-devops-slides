# Day 4
### Postgres and Migrations

---

## Lightning SQL Review

* Databases
--

* Tables
--

* Columns
--

* Constraints
--

* SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

---

## Postgresql

* Is a Relational Database that uses SQL
--

* What does Relational mean?
--

* It is free to and open source with thousands of contributors

--
* It's going to store our data!
--

---

## Databases AND Schemas

* Create Database
--

* Create Schemas inside the Database
--

* Create Tables inside the Schema
--

* Reasons to use Schemas
--

  * To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other.
  * To organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.
  * Third-party applications can be put into separate schemas so they cannot collide with the names of other objects.

---

## psql CLI

* CLI = command line interface
--

* Allows you to run postgresql commands on a database
--

* You can Create, Modify, Update, Delete anything on a database
--

* \h alter - provides help for ALTER command
--

* \q - quits psql program

---

## Database Migrations

* When you do the below... as part of a build/deployment
--

  * create a database
  * alter table(s), column(s), constraint(s)
  * insert data
  * translate data

* The database changes have to be rolled out with the new code files changes
--

* The code won't work without an updated data source
--

* Like deployments, migrations are named/numbered

---

## Flyway for Migrations

* A Java library that makes database migrations easier
* You make migration sql files that create/alter the database as needed
* You execute the migrations using Flyway gradle tasks
* Flyway keeps track of the migrations applied in a special migrations table in your database

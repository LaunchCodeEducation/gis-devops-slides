# Agile Development

---

## Your Hired!

You lead a small software company that has just been hired to build a specialized tool for Acme Co. They've agreed to pay your company a fixed amount of money for the product.

You need to ensure that you deliver what they want, and that it doesn't take too long.

How do you most efficiently build a stable, quality piece of software in an amount of time that doesn't lose your company money?

---

## Some Considerations

- How can you determine exactly what the customer/user wants?

_Requirements might change over time, especially once the customer sees how their desired features *really* work within a tool_
--

- How can you ensure that the product is stable and bug-free?

_Lots of people working on the same code base can lead to unintended bugs_
--

- How will your team plan and communicate throughout the process?

_If developers aren't working in-sync with each other, it will be easy to waste time and create bugs_

---

## What is Agile?

It is **not**

- A process
--

- A product
--

- A tool or framework

---

## What _is_ Agile?

--

**Agile is a set of values**

--

The Agile Manifesto:

- **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
--

- **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
--

- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
--

- **Responding to Change** over following a plan
--

---

## Processes for Agile

There are many ways that these principles are put into practice:

- **Scrum**
- **Kanban** 
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** 
- _and many, many more..._ 

--

In practice, teams often blend aspects of different agile implementations to find what works best for them. This is in the spirit of agile itself!

--

We'll introduce some processes most commonly associated with Scrum.

---

## Planning and Workflow

### Sprints

Agile teams of organize work in sprints. A **sprint** is a short duration (usually 1-2 weeks) during which a well-defined amount of work is attempted.

--

### User Stories

Define features from a user's point-of-view

**Example:** As an admin user, I can create accounts for my employees so that they can have access to important information to do their job.

**Example:** As a visitor to the site, I see recent company news when visiting the home page so I know about important announcements.

--

We'll discuss user stories in more depth tomorrow

---

## Communication

### Planning / Sprint Kickoff

At the beginning of a sprint, teams decide which stories to work on. They also **estimate** stories, which is a way to not only determine how much work a story might take, but also a process for clarifying and breaking down tasks.

--

### Stand-ups

Short, daily team meetings to discuss what each member has done recently, what each team member plans on doing today, and whether or not anybody else's work is blocking theirs.
--

### Retrospectives

Regular reflective team meetings to discuss bigger picture vision and planning, along with what can be improved about processes and communication.

---

## Testing

--

### Unit Testing

A **unit test** test a single "unit" of code for a single, specific purpose. Applications will have lots and lots of unit tests.

**Example:** Test that user signup validation does not allow passwords with less than 6 characters

--

### Integration Testing

Testing the entire application to ensure the units work together properly. Can be done in many ways.

**Continuous integration** is a workflow that uses automation tools to regularly test and build code.

---

## User Feedback

### MVP: Minimum Viable Product

Create the smallest application possible, and release it to users to get feedback

**Example:** LaunchCode Learning Tool ("Pathways")

--

### Frequent Releases

"Just ship it!"

Regular, frequent releases ensure that code is written in small, frequent cycles, reducing bugs and resulting in more regular user feedback

--

**Example:** Codesplain
